It made my system faster which i didn't think was possible, it has a more creative appeal, i didn't lose any of my important files and the installation went smoothly and without any kinks whatsoever Windows 7 is fun, fast and creative, , it finally gave a newer more interesting look to the paint program and i have no issues at all  My notebook runs so much faster .
