The one standout is location , ,  it's only about a block from the Gloucester Rd tube station, which is on the Picadilly line that connects to Heathrow, so being on the west side of London, it's a shorter ride to and from aiport and a very short walk to your hotel with no changes, and then you are close to public transport for the rest of your stay .
