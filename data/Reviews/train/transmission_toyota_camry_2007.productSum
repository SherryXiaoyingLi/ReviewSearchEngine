The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .
