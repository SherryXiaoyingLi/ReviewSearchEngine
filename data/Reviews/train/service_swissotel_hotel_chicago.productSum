As for service issues, the concierge gave us erroneous info about the Navy Pier trolley  the maid failed to replace toiletries and towels, despite a $3 tip that had been left I normally tip $1, 2 per day and wait until the day we leave to tip the maid, but I decided to try something different this time since we were at a 4  potential, but is probably in need of a renovation and some intense customer service training for its staff .
