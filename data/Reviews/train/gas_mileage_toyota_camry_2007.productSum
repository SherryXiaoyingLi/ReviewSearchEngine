I purchased this camry, three weeks ago, acceleration is a major problem, just not like the older models of camry, was in a accident, hit on the front right side, right fender, car was considered total loss, not fixable, I would not purchase another camry disappointed is this 2007 camry, gas mileage is not as good as prior years, i had to purchase another vehicle, it was not a camry, made in ky, it was a solid 2007 toyota RAV4 made in japan .
