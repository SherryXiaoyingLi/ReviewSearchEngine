My son bangs on it HARD and it holds the tight fit.The plastic is not crystal clear, it is translucent, but you can still make out whats on the other side pretty well.I liked it so much that I decided to keep it and convert it to a swinging gate because of the climbing over issue.My son is not too much of a climber, so I can't attest to that.
