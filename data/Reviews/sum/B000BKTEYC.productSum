Its also great to use if you want to watch a movie...I just pull it next to the couch, and ever so often talk to him and help him play with the toys, by doing this I can enjoy a movie with my husband, keep my son entertained(the entire movie), and not feel like I am ignoring my son.It isn't as hard as it seems to put together, except for that rattle roller with the monkey's in it...It was a pain to get on, lol!
