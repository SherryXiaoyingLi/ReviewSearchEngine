I agree, it is a pain that the light show is only on part of the ceiling if you have the side of the crib up against the wall but I just pull out the crib a little bit and baby doesn't care as long as he can see some it he's fine.I would like if I could choose to have it run longer on some nights when he's not going down to bed so easily as my going into the room to turn it on again can be too distracting for a nursing baby.I say this and/or the aquarium are musts in every babies crib!!
