I imagine one would probably add an icepack to keep bottles cold for more than an hour or so, though.PRO's:--Inexpensive--Well-insulated--Separate storage in top is also insulated, or can be used to hold a spare outfit, hat, etc.--Lightweight--Nylon construction is easy to clean on the outside--Interior is easy to wipe cleanCON's:--The strap is a bit narrow; sometimes it slips off my shoulder--If you're using wide bottles I imagine you won't be able to fit as many in the bag--As it's both tall and narrow, the bag is prone to falling over in the car unless secured against something (I loop the strap onto my Avalon's transmission shifter and it sits perfectly against the center console on the passenger side)BOTTOM LINE:It's inexpensive, lightweight, and keeps a full six standard-width bottles snug and cold.
