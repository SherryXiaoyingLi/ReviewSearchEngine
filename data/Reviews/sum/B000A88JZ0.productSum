I do not agree with many of the reviewers about these causing less pain...in fact, I find these hurt my breasts with their "massaging" (really the plastic is just a little more flexible than the others so they flex a little at the cone part, hence "massaging" the nipple) After the first time I thought I was going to have to trash them....but then I compared the amount of milk I got using them, and it was almost double that of the typical medela shields....so I tried again, and on a lighter suction, at a faster pace, and they were more tolerable.
