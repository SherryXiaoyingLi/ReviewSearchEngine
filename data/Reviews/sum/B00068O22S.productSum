There are two problems with them: (1) it is pretty easy for our 20 month old child to remove them by either simply pulling on them and removing the knob from the stove panel or by unlatching them (he primarily just pulls on them and the knob with cover comes off; one of the reasons that the knobs come off easily is that the plastic covers take up space and therefore the knobs can't be pushed in all the way, therefore their "grip" on the stove is compromised), and (2) every time you need to use the stove you have to unlatch the covers which becomes burdensome.Anyway, we threw them in a box for storage after a few weeks of trying to deal with them.
