The plastic material of the lid is very soft, which means they can be bit closed too easily, but the advantage of the soft material is that you can poke through it very easily to reopen and save the lids.I wish you could buy the lids separately because the cup last forever, but the lids become clogged can be bit and easily shut, so don't throw out the lids, just poke the holes back open.Compared to the Nuby cups, i think these are slightly better.
