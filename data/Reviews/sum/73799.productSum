I kept checking back until 4:30pm when I said I couldn't wait anymore and they gave me a pickup truck for the first day, I told them I needed a car for the next day as I needed to take passengers to the wedding, the next day they told me they had nothing available and told me to drive the truck to the airport and switch it for a car there, as I had to be at the wedding, and had been very polite up until this point, I got a little angry with them and suddenly a car appeared for me, they also knocked $100 off my rental for my troubles, I find it annoying when being polite gets you nowhere, and when you start raising your voice a little all of the sudden things go your way, it really shouldn't be that way....
