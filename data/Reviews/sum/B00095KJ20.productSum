My baby loves loves loves chewing on all things, soft toys, teethers, everythingShe still does...but for some reason these didn't catch her interestThe one that was most interesting for her was the pea as it was shaped differently and maybe was slightly more interesting as it had two 'arms'otherwise, the other 3 toys went unused pretty much after I washed themMaybe this is meant more for a younger baby - mine was 7 months when I purchased them for her as new chewing friendsOverall, overpriced and a waste of money in my situation
