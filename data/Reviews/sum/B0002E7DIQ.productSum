this pillow rocks, it does take up some space, but if you get more sleep who cares i do recommend using an old pillow case and cut hole in it so you dont have to remove cover to wash its a pain to get back on and i ripped mine, but  still its like a dream and was hard to give up lol My hips still hurt a little in the morning, but when I tried sleeping without the pillow for a few hours one night, I really felt the aches and pains and I couldn't sleep - so the pillow is a godsend.
