I ordered two sets of these to add to the two that come with my pump (6 total), as well as extra membranes, valves and shields so that I can pump and then throw the parts in a baggie each time I use them to be cleaned and sterilized later - saves me time from having to either wash parts in the sink at work or from using the expensive wipes you can use without soap and water.
