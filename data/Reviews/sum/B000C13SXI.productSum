This might be due to my high flow milk but I still have this problem and it is annoying.I read other reviews and after replacing the tubing with a longer one, rotating the white membrane toward the breast, lowering the suction speed, and keeping the bottle a bit more inclined I still had milk backing up into the tubing.
