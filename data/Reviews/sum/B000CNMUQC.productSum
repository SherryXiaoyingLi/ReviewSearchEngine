While I'm happy that the seat works - I hate it because I still need to clean things up when my kid gets off the seat.In comparison to the other seats I've purchased, this seat is the best because less pee gets on the floor - I might just have to try putting silicon around the base to keep it from filling with pee though...UPDATE:  I sealed all the edges of the seat with some silicon caulking (got it from Lowes for $3) and now the pee goes where it's supposed to go - into the toilet!
