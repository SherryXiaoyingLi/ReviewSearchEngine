The only negative thing I can think of is the bassinet unit it self just sets into dock and I wish it clicked or something just for a little added security, but besides that no complaints from me and I'm a very picky mommy!!!I would defiantly recommend to anyone who wants to get the most for their money I don't know if this was just our unit or not, but it is annoying to have something new, not be perfect in appearance.Also in the bassinet, the head can be raised which is a wonderful feature.
