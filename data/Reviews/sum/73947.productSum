This is actually a long time coming...to start with we have been staying at the Sheraton for many years now in the summer...2 yrs ago we had my grandaughter's birthday there, inviiting her little friends from chruch and school..her first party was when she was "5" it was the best kind of Birthday ever, it was August..we ordered Pizza and Lemonade for everyone and was so good..I can't even tell you how great we were treated and they even put "Happy 5th Birthday Marissa" on the Marquis...so, then last year we asked Marissa what she wanted to do for her birthday and she wanted it at the Sheraton again..The attention from everyone, the dest, the manager, the pool people, they all remembered her from before..they even gave her a present like the theme of her party..I can't say enough about the Sheraton crescent..it is our summer home..the rooms are so comfortable and nice, and again the staff (all of them are exceptional) Marissa says she wants to have her birthday there for the rest of her entire life..thank yu everyone for all your attention and not just to us, they treat everyone so well..You make our Summer..
