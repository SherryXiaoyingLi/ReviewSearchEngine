The shape sorter on the front and ball chute (which makes noise) are the perfect size for baby (our daughter is 9 months old).While it is lightweight and not perfectly designed (I've rarely found anything that is), your child should only need to use this toy for a few months at the most before they outgrow it or learn how to walk on their own.I do think it is a bit overpriced for what it is mostly because it does have such a short lifespan (not that it will wear out, just that baby won't need it for too long).I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has hardwood floors.
