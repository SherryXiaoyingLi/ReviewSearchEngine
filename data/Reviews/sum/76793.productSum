the fruit was old and wrinklie, syrup was almost empty, again no where to sit and signs saying no food in the rooms so had to go back and forth 3 times to finally get a place to sit and then only ate a waffle because like i said the fruit was old and wrinklie, the danishes were stale and dry, horrible place i would never recomind it to any one i liked and its really a shame because we stay at choice hotels alot this year alone 12 times not counting another hotel we love to stay out (different chain).
