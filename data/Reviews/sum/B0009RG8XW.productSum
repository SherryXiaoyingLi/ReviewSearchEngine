We have another blanket that has fleece on one side, which is nice and cozy, but we also end up having to put it in the wash more often b/c it gets wet dirt/mud on it, or if my kids spill on it, things soak in rather than wipe up.My husband, toddler and I fit fine on it but when we add baby to the mix, it can get a little crowded but we all still fit and I would not call it a deal breaker.
