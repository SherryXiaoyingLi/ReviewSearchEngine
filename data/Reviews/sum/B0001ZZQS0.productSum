(I'm just re-iterating here about the price because someone commented the Marathon is nicer but costs too much - look on line and you can find the Marathon for the same as BRU charges for this seat - and you can find different covered roundabouts for about three forths of the price)But with all that, this seat *is* a very good seat for the category it is in so I can't *really* say it's a strike against it that it doesn't accomadate a larger child.
