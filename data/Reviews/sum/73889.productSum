We left a jacket with a new cell phone in it at breakfast one morning and didn't get back to the hotel until mid afternoon and the staff had secured the jacket and phone for us and had it waiting for us at the desk; we can't tell you what a relief that was to have this wonderful staff take care of us like that and not have us deal with replacing a new cell phone and jacket.
