The old adage of â€œlocation, location, locationâ€� when it comes to property is somewhat valid when it comes to hotels, and The Four Seasons at Beverly Hills certainly is well located, but I believe the best description for this hotel is â€œservice, service, serviceâ€� We have stayed at a few Four Seasons properties before, including Cairo and Sydney, and the major differentiator between the Four Seasons brand and other 5-star chains is the great level of service.
