It can "stick" going over bumps or rough patches (some iced-over snow on a sidewalk, for instance)--but I'm not on those surfaces very often, and the convenience of the snap n go far outweighs the few moments when I have to shove it over a small obstruction.I also, now that my monstrously tall daughter is about to outgrow her infant seat, am very glad that I did not purchase one of the "travel systems." I'm looking for my "next snap-n-go"--the stroller that I will keep in the car and use for errands, plane trips, and the mall.
