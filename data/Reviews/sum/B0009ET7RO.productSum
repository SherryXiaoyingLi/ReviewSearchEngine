Through my own experience and conversations with other breastfeeding mothers, I have realized since I had her (and have been experimenting with bottles so I can maybe have a break once in awhile) that orthodontic nipples are not a good idea if you are trying to teach an exclusively breastfed baby (particularly a stubborn one) to accept something other than mother's breast.She may be willing to take it when she is older and isn't so particular (she is 2 months old right now), but another thing that I don't like about these is that they have so much room for bacteria to hide, whereas the soothies are one piece and easy to clean, so even if she would take one of these later, I don't think I will bother with them.I am not concerned about the effect of the non-orthodontic pacifier on her teeth because I don't plan to let her use them that long and my son had no dental problems at all using soothies and stopping at one year.
