It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it.- the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position- this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo- The cloth is very wipeable, not as absorbant of spills and stains as my EvenfloCons:I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat, and one that might (depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend).- The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat.
