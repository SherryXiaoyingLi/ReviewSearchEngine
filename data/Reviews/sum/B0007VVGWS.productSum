2 - since it doesn't attach to the mattress in any way, it can be difficult to situate between the mattress and the sheet without any lumps.However, overall, it's a good product that I use all the time, and since it's decently priced, it's worth buying in my opinion.Grade: B+ I've only washed it once but it does seem like the ends will fray very easily so I think when I do need to wash it I'll do so on a gentle cycle and let it air dry to help it last a little longer.I would say this was well worth the price considering the size of the pad, and it has a cute print on it.
