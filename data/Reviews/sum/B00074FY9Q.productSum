Why on earth would I want my baby to suck on a purple feeder bag when he can suck on an undyed one?These are easy for my 5.5 month old to handle, and in my experience clean up pretty easily it you turn it inside out and scrub with a toothbrush as soon as he's done.These are definitely an improvement over the cheesecloth that I was previously wrapping pieces of fruit in, though we'll see how durable they are once he's gotten some teeth.
