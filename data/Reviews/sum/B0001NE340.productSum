I regret buying this stroller because the canopy is horrible!#4 FOOT REST - nice feature#5 STROLLER HEIGHT - Stroller bars are nice and tall so it's easy to push this stroller.#6 EASY CLEANING - It's plastic/vinyl so it's easy to clean or wipe down.#7 RECLINING SEAT - Reclines by a few inches (by unzipping the zipper), not enough for sleeping but enough for comfort.#8 WEIGHT - Very light and easy to fold.
