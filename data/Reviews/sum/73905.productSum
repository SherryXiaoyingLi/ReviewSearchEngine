On the website it clearly states that all rooms have upgraded beds, but mine was old, dingy and not very comfortable (I should have asked to switch when I checked in.) Speaking of checking in, when I was checking in (after waiting for the one guy on duty to get off the phone for a good three minutes - which is a lot if you are the only one in the lobby with the only employee in the place - the guy on the phone was offered a lower rate than I was paying - can't you do this from the back office?) I was given little info and sent to my room.
