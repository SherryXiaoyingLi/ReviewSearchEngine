Which is not a great way to prevent sids...Mine came with two parts that fit in the cover and has a zipper...It does fit the entire length of a crib or pack and play, and even if your mattress/crib is a little larger, it goes UNDER the mattress so it shouldn't matter if it is a little small.I would LOVE to figure out how to get her to STOP rolling down the wedge - I roll up a towel/blanket and place it under her booty/legs in a U shape, but I worry about her putting her face in the blanket/towel too.
