My daughter is a year old now and we've had this since we brought her home from the hospital.Pluses:*the night vision is great*it was very comforting to me during the SIDS danger period to be able to check on her without waking her up by going in the room*when the battery worked, it was very portableMinuses:*the battery stopped taking a charge when she was only about 7 months old so it has to be plugged in at all times now*there is a lot of interference so it can't be too far from her room or turned in the wrong directionBecause of the interference we now plug in the monitor and turn the volume all the way down and keep an audio monitor next to it.
