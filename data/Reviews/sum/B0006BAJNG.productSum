I even use them to store bottles in the fridge (my son loves his formula or breast milk cold) this way they take up a lot less space (height wise)than if I have it fully assembled.I bought some cozies for the bottles and when my son gets older, I plan to use them on the bottles and store water in the fridge for anyone in the family to grab.
