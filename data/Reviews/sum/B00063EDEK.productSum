The pillow seems a little wider than necessary - it takes up a LOT of room in our full size bed, and turning with it under the covers is an event which wakes me up every time (I suspect this is true of all maternity pillows, though).After using it for 2-3 months, and despite nightly fluffing and shaking, the stuffing has become separated and a little flat in spots, especially in the area that I place between my legs - so flat and unsupportive, in fact, that I've started sleeping with a second, regular pillow on top of the Boppy pillow to try to keep my hips level.
