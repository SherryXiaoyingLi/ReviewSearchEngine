We all have differently tempered and built babes and toddlers, differently shaped bodies, and different needs, so please take these reviews for what they're worth: my humble opinions.And here's her take on the Bjorn:"Both DH and I loved this carrier for the newest babies 8-12 lbs.PROS:* It holds them close or hanging loosely away depending on what babe likes and how tight you pull the straps.* Once you become used to the fasteners, it is super-easy and quick to put on and can even be put on with one hand while holding the baby (if pre-clipped in some spots).* It is easily adjustable from mom to dad sizing.* The clip in the back on the arm straps keep the carrier from getting looser as you carry.* The stiff supporting body keeps the wee babes upright and their breathing passages open.* The face-out position is very simple to configure and can be done without putting the baby down, while still wearing the carrier.CONS:* Like I said, we loved this carrier, but really only for babies from 8-10 or 12 pounds (which lasts about a month with my kids) because of the weight put on the shoulders and upper back.
