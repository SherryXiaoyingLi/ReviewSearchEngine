Was greeted by a "securityguard" to attempted check us in.He was a dodgy looking character with a 14" blade strapped to his hip.We had problems with our booking and was told not to hang around outside the room.There was something dodgy going on in the carpark.Dodgy people hanging around,random vehicles coming in and out looking to be up to no good.And then there were the rooms.Disgusting!
