A quick list of my biggest gripes: - had to duck to get under the showerhead - I'm 5'5"; showerhead was slightly calcified, moldy - shower curtain rod was falling out of the wall - twice (of five nights) the bathroom was slightly dirtier after cleaning than it was before - one (1) elevator to access floors 2, 3, and basement (where breakfast was) - and there were no stairs (except emergency stairs), had multiple discussions with other hotel guests about the slowness and disappointment of this one elevator to access our rooms - shared courtyard balcony with one other hotel room - electrical plugs quickly fell out of the old wall sockets - power outage one night for the single outlet that connected desk lamp, microwave, fridge, coffee maker - no in-room safe in my room - 1Queen room only includes coffee for one person; coffee maker was also single-serving - free wifi didn't always work, once with an error message that I couldn't use hotmail on their network - breakfast left something to be desired; lots of starches; few other options; watery coffee and juice - location was not worth the price (although I'm not a driver; maybe it would've seemed closer to things by car) No restaurant service for the rest of the day, altought the room had appliances so in case of a quick meal, just a visit to the nearest restaurant or Kmart to m-oven later.
