This very cute product is designed for only ONE style of bathtub spigot - the kind that has NO water diverter where the water flows out, and NO shower pull-up handle (look at the customer pictures to see the illustrations.) On top of that, this cover is too short for any of our spigots!One of our spigots has a diverter and when I tried this cover, the water sprays weakly from all sides of the mouth instead of flowing nicely towards the front.This cover won't slip onto our spigots that have a shower pull-up handle.
