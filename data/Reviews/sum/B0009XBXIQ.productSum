This stroller seems to employ a lot of functional, good ideas to make one efficient stroller!Our favorite aspects of this stoller design areL* the toddler seat slides forward and back to easily adjust and allow access to the basket* the canopy snaps open to get rid of any slack or can remain relaxed when desired* attractive color scheme, we chose the "Appletree" which matches our green & gray Chicco set* the addition to accommodate a car seat is brilliant, and makes this stroller diverse and easily customized for each use* well designed features, I was impressed by the pouch to roll up the car seat strap into, as well as other well designed featuresSome areas that aren't out favorite aspects:* due to the design, and typical to a double stroller of any type, it's not quite as easy to maneuver as a regular stroller* the tray, car seat support, and canopy each have to be removed to fit into our SUV's trunk.
