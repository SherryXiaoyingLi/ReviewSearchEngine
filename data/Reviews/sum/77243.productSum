From Hollywood & Argyle (where the "W" is located) to Franklin & Argyle, you'll pass - in no particular order: 1) The most run-down, ugliest, beat up pay phone I've ever seen in my life (wish I took a picture of it!) 2) 2-3 busy parking lots with a lot of cars going in and out (seems like I allllllmost got run over everyday while walking to/from the hotel) 3) Under a highway bridge, where homeless people tend to sleep at night (again, harmless, but you may have to encounter them while you're walking back to your hotel at night) 4) A boring looking plaza (right beside the hotel) where I saw a few "transactions" going on at 2 in the morning At this point, either you're going to close this hotel page because you're already scared off....or you'll keep reading, looking for the reasons this was voted 5/5 (if you're sticking around...good!) Because apart from those 2 "issues" noted above (which in the grand scheme of things, really weren't a big deal for me), this hotel is pretty darn awesome.
