These are tight and it takes a push to plug them in and a nail or key to take them out.As soon my 17 months old son realized that there is something cool in the wall he was able to take Safety1 plugs out, and kept bringing to me as a trophy;) So far he didn't bring Mommy's Helper yet;) I find these get stuck and I can't ever use the outlet.
