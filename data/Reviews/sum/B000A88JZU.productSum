I like the ones that come in one package better, but these are great for when you are traveling and don't want to carry all of that (I'm thinking business travel, flights, etc.).  So while I would buy the ones that are not individually wrapped for everyday use I found these to be useful as well and felt that they deserved a 5 star rating because of that.
