I wish they were slightly bigger as my baby eats 3 oz and these hold just under that.2. It would be nice if the lids had a place to write a date on as I prefer to write it there than on the bottles themselves (to be fair, there is a place on the bottle to write name and date - my preference is to write on the lid).My baby does drink out of these on occasion, and seems to have less gas when he does, so that's a plus!
