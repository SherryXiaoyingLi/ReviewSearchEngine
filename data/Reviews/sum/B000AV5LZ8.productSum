My other daughter is a little over 34" & a little over 25lbs.PRO'S*My girls LOVE it*The seat is soft & comfy*The entire thing is easy to clean*The handles help them feel secure and in control*The seat opening is small & helps them feel secure(even my tiny daughter won't slip through)*The step helps them be independant & get on potty themselves*It is lightweight & easy to travel with or take to a different room*The seat folds flat so it is easy to store when not in use*It is affordable*You don't have to clean out a potty chair*Easy to assemble-no tools required*Step seems slip proof, my girls have gotten on this out of the bath, completely soaked and not slippedCON'S*The seat might not work for boys as well(I don't have a boy to know) the seat pictured isn't the one you get*The steps don't lock down so while they are sitting they can easily push on the handles and the steps fly up, if they get carried away the seat will wobble around.
