-It looks scary when you drive up (our first thought was, "This is an ES?") -rooms are dark inside -bathroom was tiny (I could stand in the middle and easily touch all 4 walls without moving) -the bathroom is in the bedroom (whereas in most ES properties it is entered in the common area.) -wallpaper was peeling in bathroom, ceiling was peeling in bedroom -A/C barely worked (I'm not sure if it was really working at all but fortunately we hit Phoenix on a good weekend.) -Carpet looked nice, but kids feet were black on the bottom within 5 minutes (so it wasn't so clean) So, as not to be totally negative, here are my complements: -staff was incredible at every turn -workout area was top notch (but the ceiling was so low I had to slide out a ceiling tile to use the elliptical machine.) -breakfast was good; no hot bar like some ES, but the cook was excellent and really kept the line moving -the pool area was nice, with plenty of shade and well-supplied towels -it was quiet at night That all being said, I would not stay at this ES again.
