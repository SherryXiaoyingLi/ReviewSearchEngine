The lights are as sensitive as the sound, but are not too harsh that they light up a whole room at night.The battery life is great, and it beeps when the battery gets low to remind you to plug it in.The only problem I have had with it is that if you have the monitor in your hand and you walk too close to the receiver, it makes a terrible noise (due to interference of the signal) - but since there are 2 receivers, and the volume and sensitivity are so incredible, it is easy to avoid.
