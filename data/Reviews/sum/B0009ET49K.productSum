The bristles will end up contracting when removing it from the smaller necked bottles so we need to be careful and point it into the sink so the excess soap will flick into it instead of everywhere.I do use the smaller side to help clean the nipples but sometimes still use a smaller bristle nipple brush (one I got from another bottle brush) on occasion.One of the better things with this brush is that the body is one piece made out of plastic instead of a metal brush which often rusts or scratches the plastic bottles if you apply to much pressure when cleaning the bottom of the bottle.
