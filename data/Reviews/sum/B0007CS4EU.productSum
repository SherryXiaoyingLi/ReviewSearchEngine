Yes, they are smaller than advertised, but I like and would recommend these because:1) They are covered so the smells from your freezer doesn't get into the breast milk and/or baby food purees.2) Keeps the foods safe & its easy to label the lid so you know what's inside.3) Great to freeze and transfer foods to ziplock bags for long-term storage.4) Lid fit securely - no accidents.Be sure to leave the tray out on the counter for a couple minutes for easy food removal.Overall, I used them a lot for purees and were a good buy.
