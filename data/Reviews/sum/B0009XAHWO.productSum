These are good and my boys wouldnt use any other kind but they cost so much I have twins so I need double the amount that a single baby has I tried the Dr browns stage 3 nipples and the switch was no problem they are exactly the same I bought mine in the store for $3 and the Playtex ones wee $5 and having to buy 8 packs it was a lot less money that's my only problem with these Exactly what I wanted and they were brand new when I got them.
