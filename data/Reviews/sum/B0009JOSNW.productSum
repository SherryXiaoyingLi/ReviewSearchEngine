I then bought the Ergo carrier and my son and I are comfortable and happy and we can continue to comfortably use it until he is 50 lbs (not that I will...lol.) I would not recommend buying this somehow very popular product because there is no telling how long you will be able to use it and it is very hard on the lower back.
