This is a little annoying since you need to make sure the gate is perfectly aligned with the holders, and it's a bit difficult to do alone.Taking the gate down is very easy (pull and turn the lever to release the pressure lock, then close it and put it to the side).Because it's annoying to put the gate up though, we end up not using it as often as we should.
