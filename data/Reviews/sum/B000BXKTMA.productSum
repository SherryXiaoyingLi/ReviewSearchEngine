I mean, we're talking absolutely disgusting stuff here!I did check out the half-dozen lidded potties at Babies R Us (that count is a stretch -- some are Dora while others are Thomas) and they all suffered from too many pieces, removable pee shields, etc.This PRI isn't perfect in some of those same ways: for instance, the squishy seat sits atop a molded plastic "carrier" -- the thing the handles are attached to), providing a place for the pee to hide, and the fine non-slip texturing on the lid only makes it that much more difficult to wipe down.
