It's great for putting under your baby's head so she can look up at the hanging toys, and of course, it's perfect for "tummy time."  The pat mat and liftable flaps on the mat of the gym give baby some interesting things to play with and look at at floor level during tummy time, too.On a side note, I took a Kick and Play Piano and tied it across the other "short" side of the gym (opposite where the water-filled music box is) and it's worked out wonderfully.
