We required 2 nights accomodation in Phoenix during a very busy time.Unable to get something in Goodyear we opted to stay downtown.We wre able to get a room at the Renaissance.The staff at check in were extremely welcoming and accomodating.Seeing we had 5 in our family they gave us a large corner suite that turned out to be just fantastic.Beds were comfortable,coffee maker in the room was very good.Fridge was usefull .Pool and work out facilities were excellent.For the price you will not go wrong staying here.Walking distance to many interesting venues and light rail right across the street.
