where ever you put it together it has to stay there, will not travel thru doorways, and you can not take it apart once its put together the directions even tell you this tbh my son slept in it a hand full of times, and now it will just hold stuffed animals lol we got a cosleeper thing we used till he was ready for his crib around 5 mos Thank heavens she was starting to sleep in her room, else she would be in bed with us every night, which I am not too keen on.Yes, it is beautiful, but I guess I wouldn't pay so much for something which will be outgrown so fast.
