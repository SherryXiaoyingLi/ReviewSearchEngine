the room we had was so tiny ...we paid $665 for two nights ....the towels were skimpy the bathroom was so small that you had to set the waste basket out if you wanted to close the door...you had your knees under the sink when seated on the toilet.......the bed was just a double...only one chair...the safe was so high in the closet that we could not use it with out a ladder.....they did supply two luggage racks...........the hall ways to our room were decorated with such a dark effect...it was claustrophobic...........the lobby of the hotel is bright and cheerful during the day....at night it doubles as a bar............the breakfast was not included in the price of the room and cost $14.95...think cruise buffet..not worth it...only reason to book this hotel is location.....just off times square close to the theater disctrict The front desk was very helpful in organizing Taxi's to the airport, directions to sightseeing locations and great restaraunts in the area.
