There is a breakfast,dining lounge but that also is an extra cost.It's a full buffet breakfast not the usual Best Western express fare..There was a good selection of foods and the staff wait your tables to offer beverages.My only complaint was that the head of the dining room was a little too tense and he made us feel pressured if we hadn't left the dining room by the end of breakfast time.I am guessing that the reason being is that many conferences are held at the hotel due to it's central location and the dining room is in constant use during the day so the head is on a tight schedule.However if you miss breakfast at the hotel there are many alternatives close by.There's a Whole Foods about ten minutes walk away.
