The Service could have been better and overall the restaurant was not up to the standard of his New York one, but it was a dining experience, a little more laid back style - but no Candy Trolley - which was exceptional in the New york Resturant Not far from the Hotel is "The Ivy" restaurant and the Concierge staff can normally get you a reservation, whilst we did not eat there on this trip (2006 was enough as the food was fine but the service not great and their attitude was poor and quite agressive if you felt the service didnt warrant a huge tip) if you want to see the Paparazzi in action this is the street to be in,.
