Brown's nipples do not collapse when the babies suck, the nipple is perfect shape and size, the flow is consistent and the unique design eliminates the air bubbles, so there's definitely less gas than we experienced while trying other bottles.I took away one of the stars because of the minor problems we had with this set: these bottles require more time and effort to clean, they leak occasionally [no, I didn't fill them above the line and no, I did not overtighten them - have no idea why they leaked], the larger bottles do not fit in most of the insulated bottle totes that come with diaper bags or sold exclusively for baby bottles [and that was a little bit of a problem for us, because we only use bottles when going places, but we solved it by using a larger/taller insulated lunch bag from Ikea store] and the 4-oz bottles that come in this set will be outgrown pretty quickly.
