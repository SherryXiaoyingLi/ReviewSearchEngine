Just wanted to express my positive feelings about a recent stay at the Extended Stay America, Midtown in Phoenix...Because there was a rent-a-car shortage in the city, during my stay, I decided to stay at a place near the new Light Rail, and was happy to learn that this property was a about a block away from the train stop..(which takes you to downtown Phoenix, and on to points east like downtown Tempe)...Another convenient aspect was that it was walking distance to drug store, market, restaurants, coffee places, etc...(Great central location)...In relationship to the hotel property itself, I liked the decent size of the room, the kitchen...felt like a small studio apt...Also liked the breakfast area in the morning, & the pool area...Staff was friendly & helpful...I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone looking for a safe central Phoenix location close to the new Light Rail..
