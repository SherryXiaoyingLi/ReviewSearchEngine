The one my mil bought has the cup as an inset into the top and when my little girl sits on it, it sticks to her bottom and well, I'm sure you can guess what happens when she has used it...Unfortunately she stood on the lid of the potty and the seat cracked and I thought it best to get another, to keep her from getting pinched in the crack, but when I went back to the store to get another, they didn't have this version any more.
