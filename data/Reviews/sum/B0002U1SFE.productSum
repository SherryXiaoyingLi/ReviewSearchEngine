(The key is to only have them in it for shorter periods of time so it's always new to them.) We even schlep it up to our summer house (we would have bought another one, but he'll be out of it soon) and the top and bottom disconnect easily, although it is still pretty big...I love the music box that has a cow, cat, dog and duck and when the child presses one of the buttons, it will say the name of the animal in English, then in Spanish and then play a part of a song--all the songs are different for each animal and best of all, they're not annoying!
