If I want a coffee I will stop at a cafe, sit down and drink one, not drink it on the go)- Easily maneuverable- Used with a Graco SafeSeat it will be a useful stroller for a year- A cheap way to test the waters to find out what you really need in a stroller because you really do not know before you have the baby- Fine to use with exercise groups such as Stroller Strides- Baby faces you so you can talk and interact (I am not looking forward to getting an umbrella stroller)- Holds car seat in firmly (often one of us holds the stroller handle and the other holds the car seat handle as we go up/down stairs- I recommend every one to get a SafeSeat car seat and this stroller frameNEITHER PRO NOR CON- Comfortable for me at 5'4" tall but my 6' husband finds he can only take short stepsCON'SThe cons I notice I attribute to it's price.- Non-extendable handles- Two handed fold- Feels a little flimsy sometimes- And the main problem: small, hard, wheels with no shock absorption.
