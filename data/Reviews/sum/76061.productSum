A friend and I stayed at this hotel in early April 2005.....I expected more from the Crowne Plaza brand.....I think this hotel used to be a Holiday Inn....then changed into a Crowne Plaza.......the room was an adequate size.....bathroom adequate....etc....no frills.....the location is great though.....a reltively short walk to Rodeo Dr, etc......I would definately recommend renting a car.....the beaches are a close drive.....but I think your own car just makes things easier......make sure you join the Priority Club, for that you get a free continental breakfast (that is actually good)...$10 parking.....and a room on a higher floor......which is cool, to get the whole LA effect......everything was just peachy, until on our second day I went to the ATM....had no money in my account.....called the bank.....they told me Crowne Plaza had put a $1,092 authorization on my account....HELLO!....PANIC!.....(should have only been a $546 hold) after an hour on the phone (while @ Universal Studios) it got partially taken care of......the management seemed concerned.....but didn't express it very well...to me, the panic stricken tourists in his 2nd day on a week long vacation AND NO MONEY $$$$$$.....all in all, I think I'll give them a second chance on my next stay.....make sure you ask for the Internet rate of $98.46.....great rate for the area..
