This bottles are great, so far there is nothing negative to say about these.After about 2 months of use:- No spills or leaks- Baby gets less air in her tummy, burps a tiny bit less (the ventaire system might help a tiny bit, but do not expect a big difference)- The shape is more comfortable to use (specially when the last 2 ounces of milk) for both parent and baby- It's slightly hard for the baby to drink from it (which is great if you're breastfeeding, a lot of bottles allow the water to freeflow down, and it makes it hard to go back and forth between the breast and the bottles) Baby has to actually suck on it, instead of the automatic trickle down of most bottles.These are our favorite bottles, slightly edging out the Avent, and much better than the Medela ones (which are way to soft and easy for the baby to drink out of - makes the baby real lazy for breast feeding) They are easy to clean, and I love the fact they have covers to keep the nipples free of dirt/dust, etc.
