What I don't like it is that it is thin (not a big deal) and the "rectangle top part" (it is three-piece construction, and I am not sure how to describe the part of the sheet that is on the top as opposed to on the sides) is smaller than the actual top of the crib mattress, so you see seam lines about 1/4 to 1/2 inch in from the edges.
