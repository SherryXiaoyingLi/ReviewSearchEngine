Its major drawback are:  very loud low volume setting, very bright monitor lights (like having a nightlight near the bed -- I have in fact used it for that purpose when getting up in the middle of the night), loses reception frequently, and if the power goes out (which seems to happen to us a lot), it shuts off and you have to go into the childs room to turn it back on (not the case with our other monitor).
