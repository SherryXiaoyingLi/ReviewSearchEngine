The staff has no personality, the sheets did not fit the bed properly, the location is not the best, although the breakfast bar was okay, the staff was in there constantly walking around and in the way of people trying to get food and drinks and lastly, it was Sunday morning at only 9am the the gardener had the leaf blower going and mowing the lawn.
