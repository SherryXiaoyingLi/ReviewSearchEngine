it will NOT make a regular octagon, even if you have 8 panelsthe problem is, it  only opens to certain angles, and 135 degrees is not one of themit only does 90, 120, and 150so you can have 8 sidesbut the angles will have to be half 120 and half 150 degreeswhich is more of a square, just with bent sidesnot a real regular stop-sign type octagon!@#$plus it;s a little flimsyand there is no way to have an easy open/close gate, you have to either step over it or take a side apart every time [very hard]also you may think you can have straight sided walls longer than 1 panelyou cannotinstructions say to have them all at angles - not straighttoo weak that wayso you cannot make a rectangle out of it, or a square with sides having 2 or more panels(also, when i bought it, the store guy said ''oh what kind of dogs do you have..?''hm)wle I did not structured it as it is shows in the picture here but just wide opened it up along side the cabinets and when she tries to stand up holding it, fences tend to fall - doesn't feel so sturdy but sturdy enough not not to hurt her.
