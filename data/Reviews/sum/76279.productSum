The property looks like a Motel 6 from the 1950's - made out of tinder blocks, concrete everywhere, plastic cups and plastic ice bucket in bathroom, lamp fixtures looked like they came from Target, single paned windows - you could hear the traffic, draperies unlined and only barely cover window (not to floor), towels paper thin, iinsulation from rooms is non existent (you could literally hear the person above us peeing in the toilet), plastic corian counter top, laying in bed you could see the plumbing from the sink, the TV in the armoire was so small- it was actually a little difficult to see picture very well when lying in bed, we were told it had WIFI - sure, but you have to go OUTSIDE the room to get a signal (because of the concrete construction) - I could go on and on.
