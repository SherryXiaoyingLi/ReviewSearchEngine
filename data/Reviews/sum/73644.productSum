It's still basic but the owners are trying to improve it a bit-- better sheets, better breakfast- but the a/c sounds like a semi-- but if you're going for the dallas market-- this is a safe, clean place to stay This hotel is very bad, and the room i was assigned was in front of the swimming pool,where everything you hear.the room in appalling conditions and of the course breakfast buffet,bad without variety.when locate hotels,we must look at the areas of the lobby and the dining room.There are other hotels near this much better.but this is not losrecomiendo expensive and it is bad.they try to remodel but is not enough.
