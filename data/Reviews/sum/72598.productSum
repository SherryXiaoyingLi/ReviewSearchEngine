It was house keeping, apparently not for the toilet, only she was hoping we were gone so she could clean the room, when I asked her to look the toilet, she tried to use the plunger, but eventually, got things messier and left… upon checking out, I told the guy at front desk I was so disappointed and complained that they wouldn’t even let us use another room’s bathroom, he wasn’t surprised at all and just said “all the rooms are booked, we don’t have a spare room”… didn’t even offer any apology, apparently, when I shot a sharp look at him, he mumbled to himself “I’m sorry”… That day, my husband used the lobby’s bathroom, I didn’t use any at all, (brushed my teeth with a bottle next to the car…) OK, got to make a long story short: in the morning the toilet was clogged, they didn’t send anyone to repair, though were kind enough to hand me a plunger so that I’ll do it myself, they wouldn’t let use another room’s bathroom, and on top of all, they were rude Isn’t it interesting that this was 1 of rare occasions when I did not receive request I useualy do from Choice (or Comfort inn) to fill up a survey about this hotel soon after my stay?
