I love the playtex sippy cups but there is something wrong with the plastic and paint on these cups for some reason the paint chips off really easy so it is cute for a while but ugly when it starts to chip my son only had his Buzz light year ones for about 4-6 months and I have to get rid of them they look ugly now you can't even tell who was on them.
