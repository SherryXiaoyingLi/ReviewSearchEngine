For improvements and to rank higher in my opinion, the rooms need some upgrade treatments: * The chairs in the room were not comfortable to sit in and read - a nice reading chair would be good for a room in a hotel of this calibre * The bed was a mattress sitting on a wood frame - it was reasonably comfortable but would have been better with a boxspring/foundation underneath * The windows could use more upgraded sound proofing - I have stayed in NYC before so I do have an idea of amount of noise to expect, however I was on a bit of a loud street and close to it (was on 2nd floor facing onto 55th) and believe that the windows would benefit from more soundproofing * The clothes dresser was or functioned as if it was a cheaper design - the drawers stuck and the piece screamed lower quality (again for a hotel this calibre, I expected better) All in all the stay was decent and it is a good hotel - if the above areas were improved, my rating would be above average.
