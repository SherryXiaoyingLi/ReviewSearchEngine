So a long time ago, I just started lifting the lid up with my fingers, which creates a couple of other issues: that I then either have only one hand to remove the pocket insert from the diaper, or I have to first do that and then lift up the lid with a hand that's just touched the dirty diaper - which defeats the purpose of manually lifting the lid, to avoid getting the outside of the pail dirty.A diaper pail is really a pretty simple concept: it needs to be big enough to hold 2 or 3 days' worth of diapers; it needs to open up without the use of hands; and it needs to accommodate some form of deodorizing system.
