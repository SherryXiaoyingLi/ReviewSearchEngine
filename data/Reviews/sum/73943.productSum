There is a $28 a day "resort fee" but since we rented a car and were in and out of the hotel it was well worth the price as you do not have to tip the staff (although they deserved extra!) If you don't care about what your room looks like, or the setting of your accomodation you can easily book a less expensive room, but if you want something worth remembering, want to creat a special memory and feel pampered and a real escape weekend then I higher recommend you plan to vist this resort for it was truly amazing!
