Our son is now 15lbs and it's starting to get a little small for him, but we have a ways to go before we have to retire it.- It's smooth and simple, easy to wipe down.Cons:- The "warning" marking on the top, near where baby's head goes, has been smearing and rubbing off in the bath -- we use an oil based (mustela) cream bath so I'm sure that helps, but I'm not excited about paint rubbing off on my baby....- The suction cups don't always stick well, but that's a minor issue as there are two of us, and one can stabilize the tub when necessary.
