He does manage to get out of it sometimes but if I fit it on him snugly and tuck another blanket or two around and under it, it helps to keep it secure (we keep his room between 58-62 degrees at night so I love the microfleece to keep him warm.)  I couldn't find any other swaddle sacks as big as this one so I was really happy to find this on Amazon.
