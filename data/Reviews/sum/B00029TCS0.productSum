I didn't find ANY like it until I found this piece, which is why I bought it in spite of the terrible reviews.So, although I am complaining a lot here (AKA: tellin' it like it is), and although this piece is made of heavyweight particle board, I must say on the plus side that I am pleased with the aesthetics of this piece, for the most-part.In a nutshell: it will serve it's purpose if it doesn't chemically gas us out of house and home.
