this potty chair is awesome it is sturdy and it small enough i can fit it in my diaper bag and my kids love it if you can't get to a regular toliet bowel it works great and you can buy or make your on liners for the seat love it We haven't used it yet, but I put the 3 bags on it and have it stored in the carry bag in the car.
