It might help to have someone with you (to help hold the baby while you get the carrier on) the first couple of times you use it, although I did not.Although our daughter now walks, this carrier is **very** convenient for certain settings, and I will be sorry when we outgrow it!Note: Some other reviews have mentioned Ergo baby carriers - I learned about these only after I registered for this one (it was not available at Babies R Us), and cannot say which is better, as I don't know others with one.
