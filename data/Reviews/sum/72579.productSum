Great location (10 mins walking to Nordstrom and downtown seattle shopping area as well as space needle) Freebie: parking, wireless internet, local calls, shuttle bus <take you from and to hotel @ 7am-11pm by calling driver directly>, and most importantly, a true continental breakfast < i love the yogurt and fresh & hot waffle and many other food> Clean Hotel inside and outside and parking space is good enough to easily fit with SUV and it's located on the ground level Downside: no swimming pool or fitness center to exercise Overall, I would definitely stay again with $113 US including tax :) for me and my friends In the morning a free newspaper on the door handle and a great selection for breakfast (the best we ever saw during 18 days in the US).
