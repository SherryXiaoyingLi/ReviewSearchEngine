This may be to allow my skin to breathe, but I find that my lower back sweats and my shirt is wet after carrying the bag for a couple of hours in 65 to 75 degree weather.The backpack has a large main pocket with zippers that come from each side of the base (like most backpacks) so that it can be opened just a bit at the top or all the way.
