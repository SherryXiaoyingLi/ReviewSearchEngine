She didn't handle the complaint but promised to let the manager 鈥?who wasn't in that day 鈥?know when he returned and he would contact us to resolve the issue.(Later, after seeing a photo of the owner/operators on their site, we realised the manager hadn't been away, but in the next room the entire time.)After returning to Ireland we called the hotel to repeat the complaint and got the same woman who checked us out.
