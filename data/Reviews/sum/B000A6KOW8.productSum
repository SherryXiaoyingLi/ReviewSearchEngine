I started using a regular ice cube tray (and still do, although I'd like to get another set of these) and find that the BabyStep trays are easier to fill, stack beautifully, and since they have a (nicely fitting) cover, there's no messing with plastic bags and rubber bands to cover for freezing.Several reviews here mention that they are very stiff and it's hard to get the cubes out.
