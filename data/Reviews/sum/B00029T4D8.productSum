This fits perfectly on any standard kitchen chair and I love that there is enough 'grip' to the bottom of it that it does not slide at all when she gets in and out of the seat.This is exactly what we needed in moving her from a high chair to a booster seat at the kitchen table - the right height and width (with room to spare and grow into).
