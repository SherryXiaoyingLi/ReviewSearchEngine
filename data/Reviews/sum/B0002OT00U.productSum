I would say 98% of the food my daughter drops lands in the pocket in front, and than she'll scoop it out and eat it or put it back on her plate (or fling in onto the floor which she'll do when she's had enough).I liked the soft rubber feel of this bib compared to some others, and the strap that goes around the back is very gentle on skin and easy to fasten - it's practially impossible to pinch the skin on the back of their neck like what happened with another brand of cheaper pocket bib that we tried.Overall I would recommend the bib - even though it's over-priced you'll only need to buy one (or maybe two) for your child and you can just keep washing and re-using them.
