The elastic on the legs tends to cut in and leave marks because there is no gusseting on the inside and you need to fit the diaper tightly around the legs to prevent leaks.I prefer the Thirsties Duo covers because they are very adaptable to different folds as well as growing babies, BUT, if you're starting out cloth diapering, I think it's a good idea to try different covers and not only buy one brand/size.
