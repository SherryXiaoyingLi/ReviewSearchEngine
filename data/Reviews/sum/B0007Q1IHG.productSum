Here were my main issues:1 - I hope they've fixed this in newer models, but the baby could get the tray off by sticking his foot in the handle and kicking it off.2 - The cotton cover pills the first time you wash it, and the batting (stuffing) inside, bunches up into one of the corners.3 - The legs stick out further than the chair, so every time the baby drops little bits of food off the side (or lots of food when they're older and think it's funny or want to feed the family pet!) it gets stuck on the legs and in between the legs and the seat.
