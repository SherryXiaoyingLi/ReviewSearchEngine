I like the large storage capacity and the frog fingers but doesn't' matter if it doesn't stay up I stuck it to the wall of my tub using the very strong, double-sided, sticky tape provided (I was not, and AM NOT in favor of screwing it into my shower wall.)  It held tight with a reasonable amount of tub toys (the basket is not that large, so you can't fit any large boats or anything like that in there) for about a year.
