But I guess we pay $4 for a cup of coffee that we throw away :-)  but since my kids like it better than the playtex cups, I get to buy a few more.the straw is much wider than the playtex cup so its easier for one of my twins to drink from it and he is not able to deal with the playtex cup as easily.
