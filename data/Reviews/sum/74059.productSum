I actually found it quite depressing and reminded me of too many faded British seaside hotels.We had a room that was internal so we had one very small window in the bedroom that looked out onto an internal shaft (I think it was room 103?) and the window in the bathroom (which was huge and lovely by the way!) looked directly into the room next door and we could hear everything they were saying.
