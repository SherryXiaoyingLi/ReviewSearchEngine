However, due to the fact that it is not overly expensive and target doesn't carry solid gray sheets I decided to keep it.Also, when I first opened the package the sheet does seem very very rough, but upon washing it softened right up not as soft as the circo sheets I have used in the past, but soft enough not the irritate skin.
