So what that means is for you finicky parents, you can just give your child one at a time and toss them away as they get dirty or what not.My nephew likes them I assume because because they crinkle, rattle, are visually stimulating, and help him teeth.Again, given the price on Amazon and the amount you get for that price, I can give this 5 stars.
