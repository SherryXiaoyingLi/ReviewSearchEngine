I have been using pocket bibs for years (I even had one myself as a baby...) and so I have been a huge fan of them because of the usefulness of scooping fallen food out of the pocket, and trapping those drink dribbles.BUT it's NOT just the pocket that makes this great, because there are plenty of bibs that do that, it's the soft (I mean REAL soft) plastic that it's made out of, and the very adjustable, and soft, neck closure.
