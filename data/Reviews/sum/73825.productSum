We arrived there was a homeless person outside peeing on the sidewalk...the room was not ready...the lobby smelled of lysol ...the carpet was dirty and stained...the room smelled and had sticky bathroom floors with shoe prints on it...the room was facing the highway and was very noisy...there were workmen on manlifts so we kept curtains closed...on wednesday we went out for the day and came back to find that neither of our cards worked in the door...the front desk person was really slow and rude about it...the bar in the hotel looked like something out of the old west smelly ,,,dirty,,,our room was never vacumed and we were there Monday - Friday...and there was never any place to park..never again Holiday Inn I then contacted Holiday Inn guest relations (not for the specific hotel but the generic online customer care), who first advised that I would be contacted by the above hotel directly within 48 hours.
