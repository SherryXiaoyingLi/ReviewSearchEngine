The adhesive tabs are very small and don't cover much surface area on the seat, so when I pick up my daughter to put her on the seat, if her legs dangle or if she moves around, the cover has picked right up in the parts that aren't stuck down-- meaning that they weren't very effective unless I managed to get her to sit down perfectly on the first try, with no wiggling.
