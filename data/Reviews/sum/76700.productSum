The hotel check in took, 5 minutes tops, our room was in the main building, but the distance between buildings wasn't that far, my car is a 03 Impala and you could put two of them end to end between the main building and the building right beside it, and the 3rd buidling is directly in front of the 2nd building separated by 4 employee rooms and the outdoor pool, hot tub and deck.
