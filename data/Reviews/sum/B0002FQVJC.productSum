it does not align perfectly with the end it snaps onto.3. I wish there was a locking option for when I put my daughter in the chair, so the swing wouldn't move when Im trying to put her in it.4. I had the same problem with the mobile falling to the back, but if you move the arm forward enough, it doesn't fall back, but it wont turn, because the bears hit the area where the motor is.
