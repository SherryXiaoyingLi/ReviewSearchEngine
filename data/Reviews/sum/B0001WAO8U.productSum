It is activated by movement and sound, so if you accidentally bump it or move it too fast, or make any sound, it kicks back on...since the whole point is to lull baby to sleep, this was VERY frustrating, because you creep quietly in to get the bear, so that baby doesn't roll over into it and kick it back on, which would wake them back up again...it should have a remote control, so parents can turn it off without having to take it out of the bed, so baby stays asleep!
