this furniture piece looks great, its as simple to assemble as possiblebut as is the case with all malasia and china furniture the thing is as flimsy as the restdont think you are getting a quality item for 200 buckstop and drawer fronts are 1/2 wood all the rest is particle boardknobs wont last, the screws are too small for the drilled holesall in all its worth 100 bucks in my mind The main structure crosses one of the drawers so it decreases the space.
