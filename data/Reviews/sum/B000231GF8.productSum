It was so nice to be able to pump directly into the liner, rather than pump into a bag that then needs to be transferred to the liner (what a mess!).However, there were several cons to them:1) the sealing disks start to leak after several uses2) if you want to build up any sort of supply in the freezer, plan on spending a LOT of money because you cannot just buy extra pieces - you must buy a whole new kit, and each kit only provides storage for 4 bottles!3) if you have a double breast pump, you have to buy 2 kits in the first place cause it only has 1 pump adaptor!I like the playtex premium nurser, and wish the storage kit was more economical (and even if not economical, I'd like it if they didn't leak)I recommend you save some money and buy the Gerber storage bottles, which come in a package of 4 and are very inexpensive.
