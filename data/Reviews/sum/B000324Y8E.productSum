Add to that the fact that I am far from handy, and you had about four returns (of gates that I couldn't make work), a few sets of drill holes in my stairway and a major headache before I finally got this `Safety 1st Perfect Fit' gate installed.Right off the bat I had some issues with the way the gate closed.
