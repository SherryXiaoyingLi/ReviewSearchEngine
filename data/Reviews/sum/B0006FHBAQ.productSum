We do not feed bottles when she and I are together and in fact will not accept a bottle if I'm around.Likes~ No difficulty transitioning between breast and bottle, due to the wide nipple base and collapsing liner~ It's easy to find the drop-ins (including store brand liners that fit the nursers) in any store~ No leaks!~ Inexpensive~ Minimal washing is necessary if you're careful (just the nipples; we reuse the rings and caps unless there's a need to wash them)~ Using thePlaytex Drop-Ins System - Breast Milk Storage Kit, I'm able to keep extra milk in the daycare freezer - all her caregivers need to do is thaw the drop-in of milk, and put it into one of her nursers, and it's ready to feed.
