It's pretty high (in fact, too high for our dining room set) and the armrests mean your kid will most likely not fit up against the table when you move away from the tray to sitting at the table with mommy and daddy.The straps are nice and secure, it reclines and the seat padding is quite comfortable.But in the end I don't think we'll be keeping this, the non-removable armrests and the sheer size of it make it too impractical for our table.Be sure to check measurements before purchasing this chair.
