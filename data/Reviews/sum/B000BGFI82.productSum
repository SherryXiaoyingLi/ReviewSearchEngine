Also, when I'm traveling with this swing, I need to set it down to put the baby down and open the car door but there are no wide, steady feet to set it down on, you just have to let it collapse on the floor.So you see, love the swing, wouldn't live w/out one of these but fisher price could have easily perfected this one and had the market for a few dollars more.
