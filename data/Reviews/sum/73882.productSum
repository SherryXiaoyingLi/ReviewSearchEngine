The floor looked like it had not seen a vacuum in more than a few months; There was dirt, crumbs, debris and trash all along the baseboards of the walls; there was hair in the trash, all over the sink, on the floor, etc.; the room was supposed to be non-smoking but there were ashtrays and burn holes everywhere (carpet, bedspread, etc.); the room had a weird odor that was not clean.
