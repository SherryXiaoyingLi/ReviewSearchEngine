Short and to the point:- Sturdy and durable child seat- Attaches easily to a variety of tables- Easy to clean- Secure straps to keep baby from jumping out- One star off for ease of storage, since it is tough to fold up and awkward We didn't use it to actually feed the baby since it didn't work in our kitchen, but I could tell the space between the counter and the baby was too wide and we would end up with more food on the floor than anywhere else.It does seem like a solid design, so if it works in your kitchen then it's probably a good purchase.
