I tend to be a relaxed traveler on a low budget so I dont expect anything fancy...but this dump was the pits, probably the worst hotel I've stayed in for over 30 years.The room itself was filthy,there where toe nail clippings on the floor and the furinture looked like it was dragged from the city dump.I think some bad event occured in the room since the door seemed to have been beaten on by a hammer or club and a quick,poorly done and cheap repair had been done to a hole punched in the bathroom door.The free wifi should have been free since it did not work, so I can't comment on the hi speed aspect.Sharing a parking lot with a open all night K-mart means a lot of noise,traffic and people just sort of hanging out.The staff seemed bored to death and the free all star breakfast was not available.I filled out a how was your experience e-mail from super (aint) with all this info and got a sweet gee sorry our hotel sucks and does not provide promised services but we hope you will choose us again.Avoid this hole at all costs and I would also avoid super (aint) in general.
