To keep the review fairly short i'll just list the issues in bullets: - The room (366) absolutely stinks of stale smoke - it must have once been a smoking room - Most of the buttons on the phone do not appear to work: busy for room service (tried 5 times), no answer to wake up call, does not even dial for operator - Condition of room is very shabby, carpet is old and coming off the grounds, general cleaniness is very bad (not a cleaning issue, more an age issue) - Television system somewhat faulty (there is a channel that scrolls though the porn offerings (does not actually show the movies) which be an issue for some people with kids - Wirless internet signal is to weak to use (at least in my room) On the positive side, room service was on time and fairly decent, and they gave you 2 bottles of cold water on arrival.
