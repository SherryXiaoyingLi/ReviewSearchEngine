I appreciate that this is a quality-made item that is taking a good beating from my 7 month old (even with her new game of "make mama fetch my toy after throwing it on the ground"), and that this is a responsibly made toy - i.e., this toy is NOT made of toxic or hazardous materials, potentially toxic materials, or made by slave or child labor.
