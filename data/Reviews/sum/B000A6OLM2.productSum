Just a few parts (bowl, lid, blade and extra mixer piece if you use it3) many consistencies: you can use it for a few seconds, or pulse it, to chop food for older eaters, or you can hold down for a while to make really smooth foods for beginning eaters4) smooth food: wow, this thing can really make smooth baby food for first time eaters!5) you can use for other foods (not-for baby) as well6) durable: while I have used mine for several months (a few times a day), my friend has used hers several times a day for years now, and it is still going.Great product.
