When we had our carseat inspected, the inspector was adamant that this types of mirror is dangerous because it could become a projectile in an accident and potentially shatter, but I just couldn't imagine not being able to check on my little one.My son loves staring at the monkey - it's a cute idea and a definite plus for this product.Unfortunately though, because it's not a real mirror, the reflection was just too small for me in my Ford Escape.
