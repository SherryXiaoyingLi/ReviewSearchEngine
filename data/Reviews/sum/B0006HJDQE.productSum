My husband was out of town, but I was too anxious to wait for his help, so I assembled it by myself (at 7 months preggo!) It didn't feel sturdy at first and I was about to think that all of my hard work had been for nothing, but once I nailed on the backing, it stopped wiggling and moving back and forth.Overall, I think it's a beautiful piece and I'm very pleased with the way it looks in our nursery.
