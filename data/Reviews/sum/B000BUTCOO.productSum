I had an Eddie Bauer mirror that was a nightmare, so I decided to try this one and wasn't disappointed at all!It couldn't been easier to install, very easy to position in the right angle (I keep bumping into everything while trying to get the baby to sit, so that's a big plus), keeps baby entertained sometimes and lets me keep an eye on him while out and about.I make a point of only checking on the baby while stopped in traffic, at traffic lights or at stops because I have to take my eyes off the rearview and off the road to be able to see the mirror, so that's something to keep in mind.I'm planning on buying a second car and this mirror will be the first thing I'll get then.Also, the price is great.
