I ordered 4 of these to try out, was hoping for something cheaper but needed to try something other than the safety plugs, the young ones are figuring them out and other people in the house that use the outlets often forget to put the plugs back in when they are done.So the price is not bad and with supersaver shipping you can make out nice.PROS..Installs very fast and easy, from start to finish you can have the old cover off and this one in place in 60 seconds.It works!.
