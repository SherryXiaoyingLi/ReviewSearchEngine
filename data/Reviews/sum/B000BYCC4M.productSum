This pad is really nice and thick so it adds a bit of cushion (in my opinion, the Graco PAP we have DESPERATELY needs some extra cushion) and allows my baby to sleep on a softer surface when we use it as a &#34;porta-crib&#34; but I can't even begin to emphasize how important WATERPROOF is with an infant/toddler.
