This place is a destresser if I've ever stayed in one - beautiful decor, the most comfortable bed I've slept in ourside of our own, we had wine and cheese on our private balcony surrounded by beautiful trees and looking down at the charming old world fountain beneath us, we walked to dinner at Jole, which was very delicious, and returned with our own key to the Inn as it was after 10 and it was just fantastic.
