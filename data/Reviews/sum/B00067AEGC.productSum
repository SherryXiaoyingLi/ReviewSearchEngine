It is made of a soft mesh that has padding around the bars, albeit very light padding.********  Also, since it can expand at the top and the bottom separately, it makes for a grand gate to use where you have moldings- mine stick out nearly 2 inches from the wall and the gate still fits so flush with the wall that when my 90 lb lab jumps up on it with her front legs she cant knock it down.CONS  Although the gate is not supposed to leave marks on your walls from the rubber pads, it has on mine.
