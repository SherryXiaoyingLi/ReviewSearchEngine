it might be a good tub if the remove the bump and change the quality of the sling to make tighter so it will be much safer If I sit her down at the deeper end she has very little leg room because there is the bump in the way that is where they sit at the shallow end so she's constantly kicking and pushing against it and I have to hang on to her tightly.I'm considering buying another tub to use until she's big enough to bathe in a regular bathtub.
