I got these when my daughter was Dr.Brown's bottles and they were wonderful to clean them with and also found them good to clean her NUby sippy cups with because when those plastic straws gets dirty or gunky, they are a pain to clean  and these fit perfectly, i will continue to but these for both purposes!
