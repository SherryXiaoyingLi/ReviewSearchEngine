there are many activities to this peek-a-round jungle which my 8 month old twin boys have loved since 6 1/2 months old!* They love the parrot, lion, monkey and elephant balls, especially the parrot* They love puting the ball in through the top of the tree, down the chute (supposed to be a ladder) and then through another tree to the spinning yellow platform, very easy to do and aparently very fun!* Or you can drop it at the top of the waterfall, and it will go to the spinning blue disk* I love that the button to make the music start is BIG AND RED, easily seen by a baby, why arent more toys like this?* The music is not too annoying* It doesnt really eat up the batteries* My kids will sit there for a good 15 minutes just doing this, and of course banging the balls and throwing them, (we have many more of these too)* As another reviewer said, it doesnt make a horrific noise when the baby stops the disk, that happens in ALOT of other toys, what baby isnt going to grab a spinning disk?* The monkeys are very cute and my kids ALWAYS get a kick outa opening the doorI like this toy and so do my kids, and I dont see why the reviews are bad for one little "flaw" (not even a flaw) in the toy, the balls make a loud noise when they hit the disks and you cant "hear the music".
