I also use them at home for a quick wipe down just after use so that I don't have to take the time to wash them later if I am too tired or baby needs food quick.They are not so great with getting the oily residue from breastmilk out once it has sat in a bottle for a little while, but even so they do the job in a pinch which is better than just rinsing them out.
