The concept of SwaddleMe is great, but there are two main things that I found problematic: the flap of the pouch that you put baby's feet in needs to come up a lot higher than an inch or two above the velcroed arm part, otherwise baby can get his hands out of it easily, and also if the material were a little less stretcy, baby wouldn't be able to wiggle so much inside the blanket.I've found that the main benefit of swaddling is helping calm baby by getting himself under control, with warmth being a secondary perk.
