We got a fair amount of use out of it from 2-5 months, though.PROS:--The lights on the bar always got his attention and, especially in the beginning, he'd stare at them in wonder.--The hanging mirror is great (once he was big enough to see it -- see below) and can be twisted around so he can see the face on the other side.--The vibration was helpful for when he'd start to get bored.CONS:--Just the three toys, and no way to add new ones that I know of, make this really boring, really fast to an older baby.--I hate the music.
