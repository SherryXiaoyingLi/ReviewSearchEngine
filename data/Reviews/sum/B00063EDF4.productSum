The wedge itself has gotten slightly flatter with use, but it is definitely not flat enough to reduce its effectiveness in the least, and I am not a small woman (even when I'm not pregnant!).Lastly, unlike some of the other pregnancy pillows/supports out there (I'm also going to review the Snoogle, which did absolutely nothing for me), this one takes up hardly any extra bed space, is easy to "adjust" to your comfort requirements, and is easy to move around if you want to switch it from one side to the other.Bottom line: Don't wait till you're at your wits' end, like I did, to buy this wedge!
