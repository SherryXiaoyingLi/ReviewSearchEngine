Usually one of the options on the swing would calm him down (the lights or sounds or the side-to-side swinging motion, or a combination thereof, etc.).  Also, the angle on the seat and the depth of the seat make it very safe and secure for the baby - I don't see any way that a baby could get himself out of it, even if he was squirming a lot (plus there's a seatbelt).On the bad side:- The motor clicks and hums quite loudly (although it did not hinder my son from falling asleep)- My biggest frustration with the product: The lowest setting swings WAY TOO FAST, which makes absolutely no sense to me.
