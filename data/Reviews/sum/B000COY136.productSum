They are a part of his wardrobe, and I want them to be as inconspicuous as possible.-soft-absorbent-truly water resistant: there is a waterproof layer sandwiched between the two layers of terry cloth-strong velcro-both the fabric AND the velcro stay perfectly flat after repeated washings, rather than buckling or curling from the dryer like many others I have gone through-the strong velcro STAYS strong after repeated washings, not getting weaker or with repeated use or exposure to the dryer (also like many others I have gone through)-perfect size...not too big, not too small-really decent price for a pack of 10 in my opinionConsiderations:-You must make sure that the velcro is closed (scratchy velcro half fastened to the soft half of the velcro) when you wash them with other delicate fabrics, like a satin-feel baby blanket, or the very strong velcro will catch those delicate materials.
