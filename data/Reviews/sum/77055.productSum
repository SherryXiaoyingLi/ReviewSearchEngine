As if the lack of a window and sound proofing weren't bad enough, the room had no trash bin when we arrived, the room had no clock, the room didn't even have a closet or a full-size armoire, we were given a single hotel-size bar of soap that we had to keep moving between the sink and the shower, and the room had no hairdryer (and it took 2 attempts to get one that worked).
