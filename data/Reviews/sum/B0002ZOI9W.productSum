He uses this every day, when he's getting his sun time, after meals (to keep him upright), and it the afternoons for playtime.A bonus for us is that it's light enough to bring with us when we visit his grandparents.It would be nice if:- The toy's on the bar are removable so that we can put in his fave toys of the moment Maybe it's a blessing in disguise that I've gotten a defective set haha prefer the new one which I order since it can recline for NB to sleep in My son is now walking and it is going to be great in the living room for when he is watching his cartoons!Oh, I have never had a problem with it tipping forward of backwards.
