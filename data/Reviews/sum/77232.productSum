I just stayed at the dunes inn on sunset blvd, I was a bit apprehensive about this hotel prior to trip but was pleasantly surprised, the newly refurbished rooms were terrific, as I've a bad back beds are always a worry but the new beds were so good firm but with a pillow top that cushioned the back perfectly, the owners are in the process of revamping all the rooms, the hotel isn't new but money value you won't do better, I also liked the idea of an on site restaurant which offered a good variety from not so healthy to healthy prices were good, and room service was available, they also had a lounge and being close to 7 eleven and a couple of other handy shops, it was also serviced with public transport and pickup for tours, so don't expect the ritz but you won't do better for a comfy bed, clean room, room service and a handy restaurant, I would go back without hesitation the owners were welcoming and very easy to talk to.
