My wife and I have stayed at this hotel a number of times/ love the fact that we can open the windows for fresh air/ shuttle service wonderfully helpful as well as the rest of the staff/ always cheerful and helpful/ breakfast buffet plentiful and very tasty including hot food choices that are prepared fresh each day/ beds compfortable/nice kitchen for long stays/ shuttle will take you to rail line nearby/ Really like this hotel especially the wonderfully cheerful and helpful staff/ to the manager- good hiring/ always have had a good sleep at this hotel/ hotel very clean - nice floral displays around the property and the pool looks nice/ Only weakness no restaurant on site and except for a couple of oriental restaurants across the street/ none really closeby- book as early as possible to get better rates/ less expensive on weekends Walls are in need of paint, furniture is old & uncomfortable.
