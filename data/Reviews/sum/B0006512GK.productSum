It does make putting the sheet on a little challenging, but I've found that if I pick up one end of the cosleeper mattress (very easy to do as the mattress folds for storage, so I just pick up the end "flap") and put the mattress all the way on that end, then put that side down and repeat on the other side, it makes the job very easy.
