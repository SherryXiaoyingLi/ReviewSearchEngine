If you take it outside the home and dont want to spill water everywhere, then you must close this by taking off the cap, closing the valve and then replacing the cap.Now, once you are outside and have your hands dirty and your little one needs water, you need to reverse the process -unscrew the cap, touch the valve with your dirty hands to pen it and then replace the cap.Our little one likes to take the bottle and bang the nozzle against the ground and then put it back to her mouth.
