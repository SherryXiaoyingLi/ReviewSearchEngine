Most of the complaints i read seem to be from not having it set up right or being unable to wash it (The purple (well mine is purple, i have the monkey one) part the holds on to the bar comes apart, (take bar out then hold bottom half then twist top half so the top pieces holes line up with the tabs on bottom part), pull them apart then slide bottom half out of hole, and then the mat can be machine washed and air dried.
