The diaper smell eventually overpowers the scent because the bags are sooooo thin.In addition, the way the bags are placed in the box they don't pop up as you pull one out, so I'm always struggling to get another bag out as I'm handling a dirty diaper.For this product to really work well, the bags need to be much thicker so that the diaper smell is blocked NOT masked.The one nice thing about this product is the handle ties.
