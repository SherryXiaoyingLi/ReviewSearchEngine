These bottles are awesome for storing fresh expressed (and frozen) breast milk.They fit perfectly with my Medela Pump-in-Style pump parts.They travel very well (no leaking for me in two-plus months of use) and warm nicely.The ones I received had labels, white lids (a couple extra) and were packaged loose.If you run out of labels, use a bit of masking tape.When freezing the bottles note they definitely expand, even with 1oz of room at the top and will crack/break if they fall on the floor.Overall, I would recommend this product.
