There was also a pool which was nice and clean but wasn't that big and was kind of awkwardly located on the ground floor lobby with nothing but a glass wall separating it from the neighboring restaurant dining area, gift shop and front desk We had a pretty nice view of the lightning and city lights on the 8th floor but the side of the building we were on had a bit of a blocked view because of a taller neighboring building.
