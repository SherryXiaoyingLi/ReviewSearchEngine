We were leaving the hotel in the morning and could not get our children to sit and eat, so after my husband and I had eaten breakfast we grabbed two milks and two bananas to take to our two little ones in the room and the manager stopped us in the hall, asked us if we were"idiots" to think we could take something out of the breakfast room, made us put it back in the room, and continued on with the insults.
