my daughter is still a little to young to use this but it is pretty cool she tries though and its really nice because i really dont have to worry about her choking on something because she decided to put a lot in her mouth or somehting and its nice because i can give her real foods instead of the processed baby foods:) I only gave it 4/5 stars because as others have noted, cleaning it is a pain, although it's not impossible.
