Pros: - rooms are nice size all come with balconies and nice size bathroom - hotel has heated jacuzzi & pool - staff is really, really nice and make the special effort to ensure you're comfortable (from general manager, front desk managers on down to the woman in the lobby store - nice bars & club - food is decent (you can order lunch items during dinner) - quiet for the most part (as long as you're high up, in the back & not close to the X bar) - ipod stand in all rooms - good location close to century park mall ...can walk around and do shopping there's also a movie theater, gelsons grocery store, very good restaurants- houstons, pink taco and my fav rock sugar - have rental car in hotel (can cab from airport & rent car as you need) -give free starbucks coffee coupon (for lobby starbucks) Cons: - no health club- have to pay for Equinox attached to hotel $20 (hotels this size & calibur should have a health club) - valet parking is a rip off but there's a parking lot a block away at 2040 century park east that is reasonable (monthly fee of $135- perhaps cheaper daily fees) - can get overcrowded during event nights (but sightseeing opportunity for stars- if you care about that) -They don't have Bravo on TV First, there is no street parking anywhere near Century City; valet at the hotel will run you $33, and a self-park parkade on the back side of the hotel is both rather inconvenient, priced at $24 a day, and doesn't have in-and-out privileges (i.e., you'll pay each time you leave).
