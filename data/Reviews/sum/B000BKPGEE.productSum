I can't imagine with heavier babies :/ I don't recommend this product at all, it's potentially dangerous and you'll be worrying all night.On the other hand the GRACO people were very nice and tried to solve the problem, they sent me all the bassinet part for free, but unfortunately, it's the same part, and I didn't need a replacement of the part that presented the danger, I needed a solution and they don't get that they have to make a complete change in the design.I ended up throwing it away (the bassinet part) and it's only good as a play yard.
