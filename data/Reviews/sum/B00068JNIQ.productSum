This kit contains a nasal aspirator, digital thermometer with case, soft-tip medicine dispenser, comfort tip medicine spoon with cap, magnifying nail clipper and a travel/storage bag.Pros:Comes as a set in a bag (you don't loose items as easily.Cons:-I'd rather have the smaller nail clippers without magnifying glass-The nasal aspirator from the hospital is better-I think it is dangerous to use the medicine dispensers included versus the droppers that come with medicationsSummary:It is convenient to have a bag with everything you "need," but this might be more than you need, or different than you need.
