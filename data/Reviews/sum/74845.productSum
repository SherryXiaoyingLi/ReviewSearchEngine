Jason and I stayed at Comfort Inn West We stayed 12/1/09 to 12/4/09 The front desk was Polite and Friendly The Rooms were Fresh The Breakfast was Nice The Next day Jason went to a Bingo tournament and he won $50,000 and a TV I called the property & tried speaking with the G.M., and he would have nothing to do with me and threatened to add the $85.00 back onto my card, he began yelling at me over the phone, so there was no way to have a civilized dialog or discussion.
