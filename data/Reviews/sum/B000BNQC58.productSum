I also found that amazon has the best price for this turtle.Also I know this toy has been updated, but the reviews said to stick to the old one so that's why I got the old one, and not the updated Twilight Turtle We're expecting a baby boy this October, and I've been looking for a nightlight for him - then I stumbled upon this Lady Bug nightlight and ordered it on a whim based on the reviews and the fact that I loved having colorful dim lights in my room as child.The lady bug arrived about 2 months ago, and my husband and I have claimed it as our own!
