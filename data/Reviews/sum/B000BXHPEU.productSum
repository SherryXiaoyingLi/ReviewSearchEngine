they have a lot of grip and really keep the ring in placeThe minuses:the plastic is really flimsy and any kid over 20lbs (maybe less) will flex thisbecause it has to sit at the front of the toilet, there is minimal support at the back and the flexing is accentuatedbecause it has to sit at the front of the toilet, expect the best aim to go right past the potty ring and onto the nasty public toilet bowl and kid's clothesThe mellow go-with-the-flow kid that got to sit on this IMMEDIATELY asked to go to a different potty and then said DONE just to get off the thing.There aren't much better choices, but considerMommy's Helper Cushie Travelerif you need something compact.
