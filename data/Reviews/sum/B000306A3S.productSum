So I wanted to get a simple wind up mobile since most of the mobile these days are all for crib use only.I'm glad I did some research and comparison because this is battery operated which plays music for hours on end if you wanted to, it virtually clips/attaches and easily removable so I can take it around, it had a great reviews, and MOST importantly my then 4 week old and now 8 week old son seems to be mesmerized by it.At 4 week I used the black and white drawing on the opposite side of the bugs (I tried the hanging bugs as in the picture first but he didn't seem too interested where as black and white pictures he didn't want to take his eyes off of)Battery operated is great so I do not need to wind it every minute or less.It has a velcro and a clip that will attach to car seats, bassinet handle, stroller shade, play gym etc.
