I will still bring my automatic pump to work with me and will use it a lot at home too, but plan to use this one for when I travel and don't expect to pump much, and for times when I need to be more mobile around the house.Just now, during my first time using the pump at home, I received a work call (I work from home some too) and I was able to just keep pumping since it was so quiet.
