since blankets are a no-no in cribs, this is great for keeping little munchkins warm at night.I really love that the arm(s) can be swaddled or let free depending on what the kid prefers.LOVE that the sipper opens from the bottom - can do diaper check/change without taking the whole thing off.Velco closures  are long allowing for different tighness.I do wish that the swaddler (&#34;wings&#34; )part would come off completely as it did in older models, allowing you to just use the sleep sack This is good if the a baby decides they don't like being swaddled, you can just have the sleep sack and if they outgrow the sack part, or the season changes and you want them in less layers but they still want to be swaddled, you can use the swaddle wrap on its own.I also like the fact that the zipper zips from top to bottom, so the zipper pull isn't up at the baby's face.
