We have a queen size bed & it was a bit tight having it in between us...but since the sides of it are so strong, I did not have to worry about rolling over onto my baby, so I did not care.If the sheet got dirty, I put a pillow case over the pad instead, while it was in the wash, & it fit perfectly.I was a little disappointed that the attachable nightlight was broken when we opened the package but we did not really need it anyway.Overall, I think it's a good product that served it purpose.
