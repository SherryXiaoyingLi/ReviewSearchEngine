Aside from the bad side of town where this hotel is located, the obnoxiously rude staff, the offensive odor of manure in the hallways, the difficulty of opening an obviously non-serviceable door to our room, dirty carpets, sticky fingerprints on phones, remotes for two TV's nowhere in sight (not to mention the staff's unwillingness to remedy the problem), dirty bathtub, broken screen door to the balcony, missing vents on outdated AC/heater unit, missing smoke detectors, hair on pillow cases, stiff mattresses, constant scent of ashtrays in room...where am I going with this?
