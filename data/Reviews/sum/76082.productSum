Shuttle pick up at the airport is from Terminal #1 the international terminal is #2 but there is free ground transport or an easy walk to the pick up area at terminal#1...you need to call the hotel for pick up...I asked a local to call for me as I do not carry a cell phone.....the hotel is very isolated so if you want to eat...do so before going to the hotel........the king size bed was very comfortable ...lots of pillows....more towels would have been nice...the breakfast area is cheery with a sky light over a nice dining room near the free breakfast food..make your own waffles and warm hard boiled eggs were the highlites for me.....transport to the strip is on the hour and pick up point is the flamingo hotel...the bell desk there will call for the pick up for you...we enjoyed a starbucks coffee there and a comfortable waiting area after a long day on the strip Although we had a confirmation sheet with a booking number the person behind the desk insisted we had cancelled our reservation a few days earlier, which we had not done.
