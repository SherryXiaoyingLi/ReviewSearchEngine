I called Travelocitty and had them call the front desk but desk clerk would not deal with him as he was "busy" -I finally and convinced them to let me get my laptop out of the room but the maid was told not to let me stay in there she had to watch me only get my laptop that's it -It turns out the original desk clerk misinformed me - she didnt book an additional night she SWITCHED my booking without letting me know The only good things about this place were the location (sunset and la brea) walking distance to Hollywood and there is a Ross across the street (where i scored some awesome deals) The maids were nice and the maintenance guy was super nice too he helped me with my bags and declined my tip Also there is free continental breakfast and it is cheap (69-79$ a night) and i actually slept quite well For unforeseen reasons, I had to postpone a reservation with Days Inn and I provided them with 3 days notice to either change the date or cancel the reservation and they refused to do either, stating "online bookings are non-cancellable".
