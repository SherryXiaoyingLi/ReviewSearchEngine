It's WAY TOOOO BIG..for my queen size bed..It divides me & my boyfriens up completely..i always have to sleep with two pillows under my head, so this pillow doesn't allow me to because it's so bulky..I have now switched this pillow around & reversed it so the Head Part of the Pillow is now at my feet & I use it as a foot elavation pillow.
