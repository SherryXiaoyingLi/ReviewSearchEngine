The inconvenient part was that I stayed for three nights - each day my room key would stop working, and I would have to walk to the office to get it reset- usually it was while I was laying out by the pool, so I'd have to trudge down the hall in my wet shorts and wait in the lobby scaring the poor families checking in who had to look at my hairy back.
