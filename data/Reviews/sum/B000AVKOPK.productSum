i was looking for a good priced effective product for our newborn,if u r looking to throw your money in the trash it would be easier than buying this product,the thermometer came without battery and stopped working within the first week of use,the nasal suction is big even for my nose(30 years old)and u won't be able to use it on an infant,the only thing that works is the comb.bottom line spend few more dollars and get a decent set I would not recommend getting this kit, I think that you can find better quality kits around the same price or less at any baby store.
