So why am I giving it 5 stars?Pros:- great price (we paid about $130 for it) and free shipping- the instructions came with info of how to order (for free) any unsatisfactory pieces - the whole process was automated (online), hassle-free and fast; the replacement piece arrived within a week;- assembly was easy (but then, I have a lot of IKEA experience ;)- the shape means there's room for essentials on the same level as the changing pad, which means no reaching underneath or around during diaper changes- comes with safety strap (yes, yes - one hand on the child at all times, but we're first-time parents and appreciate any help)- the pad screws to the table (through the straps), so it doesn't slide around at all- easy product registration (mail or online)- compact (we have a very small nursery and that really matters)- accessible (easy to just walk up to, diaper pail can be placed right next to it without being in the way, great to be face-to-face with the kiddo while dealing with the "business" end from the easiest angle)- color matches other brands (perfect with birch cribs from IKEA - and the size matches their Gulliver better than the Gulliver table itself!)Cons:- flimsy side shelves (but then, they were so easy to just drop into slots, and don't really need to be any sturdier; and we can always glue them down later on)- flimsy, rectangular pad cover (it just doesn't fit a pointed pad, though at a push it can be stretched over it; I just made my own covers and don't consider that a drawback at all)Somebody's mentioned that already, but it was really good advice: assemble in the nursery.
