The good?* It's inexpensive* It's very sturdy* The lid stays closed/locked* The formula doesn't mix with other compartments* You can fit a lot of formula in each section (at least 6oz, I haven't tried 8oz yet)* The cup will be good for snacks when formula is doneThe bad?* It takes a bit of tamping and shaking to get all the formula out (and even then you might still miss some--but it's not usually that big of an amount to worry about)* It's a bit bulky.
