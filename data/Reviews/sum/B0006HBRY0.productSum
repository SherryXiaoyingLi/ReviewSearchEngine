We have NEVER looked back* The print is adorable, we get many compliments from friends and our babies love to stare at it next to them* The seat is VERY soft and cozy, yet its not too "sufficating" in the summer, and its NEVER cold in the winter* The seat itself was EASY to install, no problem and the LATCH system worked wonders.* The Harness is NEVERY tangly and is very easy to adjust as well* The seat is not too huge, it fits nicely in my SUV or my husbands pick-up truck* The seat cover can go in the wash, very easy to take on and off, and its easy to spot clean* The seat isnt too big or small, I think my boys will outgrow it at 3 1/2ish* It works great rear-facing as well and was very easy to adjust and reqline* My boys fall asleep comfortably in it, and they have never had car problems, at first I thought it may just be that they are great babies (which they are) but in a triumph that my mom has, they wouldnt sleep and they would constantly whine* VERY safe, we have the fire/police department check our seats, and they are installed perfectly and are VERY VERY safe* They arent outrageously expensive like the Decathalon, and they come in MANY MANY prints* The carseats style doesnt pop out my sons legs like in the triuph, and they are GREAT for attatching Link-a-doos toI love this carseat, We have 4, two for each car.
