The adhesive used is very strong: before getting used to this lock being there, I've often given the door a good tug and the lock has always held.We have bought a lot of child safety products, and this is defintiely at the top of the heap in terms of quality.UPDATE: After over a month of use, the latch is still performing like new with no signs of wear, despite constant opening and closing of the fridge door.
