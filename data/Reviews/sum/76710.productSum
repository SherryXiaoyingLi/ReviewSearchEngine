The air was turned off when we arrived and it was 4pm and 90 degrees outside,but even on high the air never got cool even the by the next day.The next thing I noticed was the bathroom,there was hair on the sink,the floor,the bathtub,other people's hair everywhere,very nasty,that is just a no no.The Hotel is not very convenient,very out of the way also.The beds were also very hard and uncomfortable and you are given a tiny almost flat pillow.I will say the pool area was very clean and the hot breakfast was a good deal and always had plenty of food out.I wouldn't stay again,it wasn't a comfortable stay.
