Heck, I had some fun playing with it.+ good variety of spinning / manipulation toys for your child to play with, if you can engage your child to do so.+ good build quality, and nice colorsCon:- while variety is good, many of the mini-toys attached were too difficult for my son to use, so he just gave up.- too heavy to be picked up easily in one hand for weaker babies / toddlers.- the tiny balls in the clear edge tubes got statically charged, didn't flow well after a whileI wouldn't buy this again, nor would I recommend it for a friend.
