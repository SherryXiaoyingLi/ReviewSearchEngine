the handles were higher, the seat reclines more and much easier, the umbrella has a pocket on the back (it's were I stick all my things, like my phone and keys), it has a foot rest that can be put up for sleeping babies(the Maclaren dosn't) and it was easier to fold up.I've had no problem's with the back like other people, the basket is small but it's an umbrella stroller!
