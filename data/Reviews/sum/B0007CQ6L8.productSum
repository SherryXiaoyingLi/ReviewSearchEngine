Plus having the baby within my arm's reach to soothe also added more hours to my sleep, which I desperately needed since I was the only one at home to take care of the baby (hubby had to go back to work after the first week).Adding the extensions does make the bed more shaky, but it's not going to collapse or tip over, especially when the cosleeper is right next to the adult bed.
