With My Breast Friend, I still felt as if I needed to hold my son, so he wouldn't fall off.We brought our boppy to the hospital, and have been using it now every day for the past three months.I prefer the boppy for many reasons:It is soft and plush so you are able to conform it around your body to your desired position,level, and comfort.My son has reflux, and needed to feed at a slightly elevated level, higher than his feet(not at the same level, as my breast friend).I can position his head higher in the boppy and still feel he is secure and comfortable against me while nursing.My son would fall asleep, and since he has reflux, and needs to also sleep on an incline, I was easily able to transfer him from feeding, to his crib in the boppy, where he would sleep in it and still feel like he was elevated in my arms.The cover on the boppy is much easier to remove and cleanWe use our boppy for more than just feedings.
