Even with the SwaddleMe, our daughter could get her hand up and out of the top, but this didn't preclude the soothing effect of the swaddle.--This knit fabric version (SwaddleMe also comes in flannel and fleece-y type fabric) is the easiest to use - fabric itself stretches, unlike the flannel, so you can get it really tight.--large "fuzzy-side" velcro patches allow for free-form positioning of the "loop-side" velcro tabs for a perfect, tight fit.--you MUST follow instructions and fasten down the loop-side velcro tabs before laundering.
