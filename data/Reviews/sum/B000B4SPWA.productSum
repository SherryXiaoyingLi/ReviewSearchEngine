I love the "hugs" system the straps have because it makes my daughter fit snuggly into the seat.I only have two complaints about this seat, which really aren't that bad, just annoyances - 1) Sometimes the straps do twist a bit and I have to untwist them, especially with an independent toddler who wants to push their own arms through the straps and 2) It does take a little bit of strength to tighten down the straps with the push-button strap holder.
