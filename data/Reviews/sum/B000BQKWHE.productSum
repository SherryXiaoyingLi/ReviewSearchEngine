The gate goes right past these and could open down the stairs if not for the handrail on the stairway that it runs into.2. It is easy enough for our 41/2 year old to open and close although we all have to pay attention to ensure the bottom side sets into its holder (i.e., just aligning the top latch does not ensure the bottom latch is in place).Having stated the negatives, I think I would buy this again.
