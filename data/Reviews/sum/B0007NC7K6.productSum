Having an extra person certainly makes it easier, but I have no trouble getting my son into or out of the backpack, nor with getting the toddler-laden pack onto my own back or down onto the couch/table/floor/ground singlehandedly.A few minor points: 1) the sunshade appears to not extend sufficiently to really shade my son (or maybe I'm not pulling it far enough out, or maybe he's shaded perfectly well and it's just my perception that he's not; hard to say), 2) it does get a bit hot, but come on, you have a little space heater strapped to your back, so what did you expect, and 3) it's very important to know exactly where to put your child's feet when putting on the loaded pack.
