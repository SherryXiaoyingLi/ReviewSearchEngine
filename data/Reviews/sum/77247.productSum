We booked to stop for3nights as we decided to stop off there after spending a week Palm Springs.I was hopeful that it would be a decent hotel having stopped in Best Westerns all over the world.However the rooms were stuck in a 1960's time warp,and were cramped,dated and a little bit grubby.I also thought the open motel style of the hotel wasn't really ideal in such a dodgy area!We decided after one night to cancel as basically the place was a dump,however the guy called Pedro on the desk was really helpful,booked us into our next hotel and seemed genuinely awaken aback at our complaints.A nice guy,shame about the horrible hotel though!!
