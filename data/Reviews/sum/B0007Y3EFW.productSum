The negatives have been mentioned in a few of the other reviews - (1) the tray is small so it only fits a very small plate and a very small cup; (2) the wooden frame for the tray is set up in such a way that it is very difficult to slide your child into the seat; (3) the tray is not easy to remove to clean; (4) the bolt on the bottom of the chair keeps coming off (my husband says it's not a hazard but I find it disconcerting; (5) the straps are of poor quality (no over the shoulder straps so my son almost crawled out and tipped over the chair once!) and difficult to adjust once the child is in the seat; (6) it does not seem particularly sturdy; and (7) my son has never seemed to like it (he's been using it for over 10 months now).
