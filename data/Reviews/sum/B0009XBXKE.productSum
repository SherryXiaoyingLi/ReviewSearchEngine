These are so great especially at times of daddy-changing-the-baby-when-pooped.Before I started to use these I'd get to wash the changing pad cover after each time my husband gets to change our son when he pooped, not to mention the clothes of both my baby AND my husband.So if you have the same situation - these are the laundrysaver :)) I should have better read the size information.
