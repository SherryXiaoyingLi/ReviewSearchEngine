I was able to slip the entire piece through my hands free bra (the "Simple Wishes Handsfree Breastpump Bra"), but not sure all breastpump bras would be compatible due to this issue.Also, this set does not come with tubing.That being said, I had read all the details and reviews, so I was prepared and happy with what I got!
