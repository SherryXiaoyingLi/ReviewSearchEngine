Or going into the  room to check on baby and waking him up.It works fairly good along our wireless network, and lots of other different-frequency equipment, the only spot I have problems sometimes is in my bedroom which was built out of the crawl space underneath the garage - so it is mostly concrete walls there.But still I get a decent picture.The only tip  - if your baby is always sleeping in the darkened room - you might as well buy a black and white one, as the picture is always going to be in nightshot anyways.The bigger screen is a plus too, considering the fact that you're going to watch the whole crib and the picture is going to be pretty small.
