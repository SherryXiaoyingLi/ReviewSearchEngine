In case anyone else is in that position, here are my two cents:GET THIS PUMP (OR ANOTHER HIGH-END ONE) IF...- You're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with this pump you could build up "reserve" breastmilk in case of an emergency)TRY A CHEAPER ONE IF...- You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended period I rented the hospital (medela) pump for the first month until I was sure I could get my supply up and breastfeed (registering for it was too much pressure!).
