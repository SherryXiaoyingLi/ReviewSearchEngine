It works just fine.With both seats, regular cleaning of the pee-stop cup is necessary because it's a game for our little guy to trying to arc over the pee-stopper.I have to say that I prefer the handle-free seat as my little guy is starting to get off the toilet on his own and the handles obstruct that.Overall, it's a decent seat for the price and that's all you really need it to be.
