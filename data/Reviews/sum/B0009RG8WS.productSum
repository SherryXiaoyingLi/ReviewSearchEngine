That made the seatbelts  fit really awkwardly and made me worry about the safety of the seat.This solves all the problems!Put in the babe lightly closed, zip up your Bundleme and off you go!It fits my Chicco Cortina 22 seat just fine.I love the fact that you can unzip the top part - when it's not needed on a warmer day or even to use it as a pad for the little one when on the go!There is even a cute pocket for storing pacifiers or whatever you want in it.Used it every day in winter months, one of the most useful baby purchases I have made.
