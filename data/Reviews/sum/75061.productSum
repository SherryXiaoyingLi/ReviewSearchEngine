The peeling paint on the balcony railings, rust and mold running from the a/c, the mold on the ceiling of our room, the lack of reliable maid service ( and when we did get it , it was sketchy to say the least,) the lack of heat in the "heated pool", the sand in the bottom of the pool (plus the fact that I only saw the owner cleaning it once in the week that we were there), the non-existence of front office staff, the total lack of care for the courtyard or any of the plants or lawn on location, the lack of sweeping the pool area of cigarette butts, empty beer cans etc., or the straightening of the pool deck furniture (I did it myself one night), the ripped bathroom screen and "extras" in the bathroom when we arrived, tells the story.
