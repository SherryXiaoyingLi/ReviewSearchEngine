I love this product the only unfortunate side to this diaper liner is that it doesn't hold in the blowouts, if your baby has seriously liquidy number twos and it's kind of a lot, it'll seep right through the diaper liner, but if it isn't too much, or it's more solid than liquid, then you should be fine, that's why I give this diaper liner 4 stars, it sure is a help, so long as my baby doesn't have diarrhea or just a lot to offer that night if you know what I mean lol I purchased these flushable liners because my daughter will be using them with our new grandson.
