We found that the catapiller musical bar (where the flower rattle is attached to) is quite loud when it plays---I don't mind loud kids toys or "noisemakers" as Grandma calls them lol but it was the loudest thing we had for baby and since they are subject to sit right there next to it (with only low or loud volume controls) I put a piece of tape over the speaker holes and now it appears to be a "medium" setting so that works.The 4 butterflies that are stationery and just for looks, almost out of babies grasp, on each of the 4 corners make the toy LOOK busier than it is, like I said they don't really move and like the poor review stated they don't come out once installed so item will no longer fit in original box.
