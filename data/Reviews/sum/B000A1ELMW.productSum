I had a few tense moments thinking that Britax has to sell replacement parts, as the EPS foam is very easy to damage if not done this way (Huge hint to Britax - clearer instructions?) You have to put the headrest contraption on before putting the harness straps back into the shoulder slots - I forgot and had to redo the whole process.Threading the harness through the fabric cover was also nearly impossible.
