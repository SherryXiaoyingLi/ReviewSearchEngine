I feel more comfortable looking away to do the dishes with the netting up because I know the dog can't lick the baby to death :) We thought of placing towels or blankets on either end, but that didn't seem safe.*The vibration is weak.*The toys are very boring and out of the baby's reach, which is pointless.*It's awkward to carry around.*After only two months, we coudn't find any use for this product.We went back to the store and bought the Ocean Wonders bouncer, which is cheaper and a much better product.
