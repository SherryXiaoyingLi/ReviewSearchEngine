very nice people - Quick and easy change to get a late check-out an hour after normal time - Great downtown location - Comfortable bed and pillows - Plug on bedside lamp (this is very nice) and 2 plugs on lamp on table (If you think this obsession with plugs is weird, try staying in a room where it's hard to find a single one and then you'll realize how many things you need to plug in (esp if you're working there for several hours) - Ginger-scented Hyatt bathroom amenities smell nice (I'm reaching for compliments here) Cons: - 50 mins room service, at 4:00 pm (!!), for one caesar salad and one bottle of water - Room service salad was incredibly average - TV has an HDMI input but the "input" button on the TV doesn't actually work, so the input is moot - TV remote is so worn, only the number "5" can be seen - TV doesn't swivel all the way to be seen on the bed, and there is only one small armchair otherwise - Bathroom is tiny.
