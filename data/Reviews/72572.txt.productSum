It is grungy, doesn't smell nice, in a terrible location - its next to a bad area (my gf was yelled at twice by bums on the street coming out of the hotel); the service staff (particularily the Manager) is rude, and tried to overcharge us when we went to leave - we had booked for 3 nights then want to check out after one night given the conditions (our opinion).
I was in Seattle for a conference and stayed at the Crown Plaza for 4 nights on my company's dime - I planned to stay a couple extra days but didn't want to pay the Crowne Plaza rate so I went with the Pioneer Square Hotel - after searching the web for an inexpensive hotel and found the PS at about half the price.
