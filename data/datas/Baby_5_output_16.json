The price of the set seems to be somewhat less than buying them separately. This would make an amazing shower gift, especially if the parents are also avid home cooks (see below on the freezer and storage containers). And the gender neutral green is bright and cheery without being obnoxious.The bib is outstanding--great for a messy baby, and also excellent for a toddler working on self-feeding skills. The big trough at the bottom can even hold a great deal of spilled milk! There's a good size range with the adjustable velcro. Our toddler has been using one since she was very small and I'm still happy with it. Just spray it down then wipe the cloth off and hang it on the high chair, and it's dry by the next meal.The sippy cup works well, is easy to clean, and does not leak. In fact, it's so effective that when my daughter tucked it, half full of milk, into a disused tote bag, I didn't find it for several weeks because there was no smell.The snack cup is fantastic, successfully coralling cheerios or other small snacks until they're pulled out, a couple at a time. There's an extra travel lid, but I've thrown it in my bag without the lid, and had no stray cheerios.You'll probably outgrow the freezer tray really quickly for baby food, unless you're starting really early. But it's excellent for freezing fond, pureed herbs, and compound butter once your baby is eating more than just a wee bit.Ditto the little containers. Our baby outgrew the 2oz cups pretty rapidly, but they're still very handy for general cooking use. I think they'll get another life when she's in school for snacks and condiments (or for an adult who takes her lunch).While I love the silicon-coated spoons for scraping up everything, and being gentle on teeth, they're just too small for everything but first meals. If I fed my toddler with that dinky thing, I'd be at it all day. The coating is inspired, but a teaspoon-sized spoon would be much more useful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent set with a long useful life", "unixReviewTime": 1397088000, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2014"},

I haven't priced out the individual OXO brand pieces, but you could probably get most of these pieces individually for a lower price.  That said, you wouldn't necessarily guarantee BPA free.  The set includes:One Sealed Ice Cube Tray - This is basically just an ice cube tray with a cover, but it's OXO brand and BPA free.  We used these to freeze pureed baby food and the cubes are a good size.  The lid fights on tight to prevent spills (although sloshing can still occur inside the tray before freezing if you're not careful.  And on the plus size, you can continue to use this for ice once baby no longer needs homemade food.Six-Pack of individual baby food freezer containers -Small (a couple ounce) Tupperware containers with lids that can be used to again, store baby food, either freezing or small amounts of fruit, veggie or other foods you've prepared.  The amounts are good for about the first two years and there's a underneath tray, so if you want to keep them together in the fridge or freezer.  Because of the small size, the tops can be tricky to get off, but otherwise very useful.One Snack up with lid - This is great when baby is 9+ months. It has a handle so baby can hold the cup themselves or be hooked onto a backpack or stroller and a twist top so it won't make a mess, but baby can  still get to the snack thru the lid flaps - great for cheerios or puffs.Two baby spoons - These are two metal spoons with silicone lips.  Good for when you're trying to feed baby, a bit too long for when the baby gets older and wants to feed themselves.One Sippy Cup - An 8 ounce sippy cup with two handles.  Basically the standard OXO sippy cup.  Great that this is included, but you'll need a lot more of whatever sippy cup works best for your child.One Silicone Bib -  With my first child, I didn't understand this type of bib, until I tried it.  When you're first feeding baby, all the food goes straight down the chin, because of the wide trough at the bottom that always stays open, this bib is very helpful.

The set of six lidded food jars are great for a lot more than just baby food - they make great condiment containers for a packed lunch.  The lids stay on tight, but can be removed with little effort, and yet never leak.  The ice cube / frozen food tray is thoughtfully designed, in a way that permits removing a single frozen cube at a time as the lid is withdrawn.  The bib is a bit on the heavy side, being made from a surprisingly thick rubber. The snack cup is a nice size and better than some of the more hand-grabbing finger-traps we've tried.

It is a very nice baby feeding set and is BPA free, which is important to my family. The freezer tray is especially interesting, because the compartments are constructed so that the food will slip out easily. Other components are standard baby feeding equipment, but all are well constructed. Everything is a great shade of lime green. I am giving this set to my daughter, who is having her first child in May. My only objection was the sloppy, dirty packaging, which was actually a re-used box with an existing label on it.

OXO, in my opinion, makes quality products, and that craftsmanship translates to this set well. The items are solid, durable, and BPA-free.By far, the best items in here are the spoons. I love that they are covered in silicone (not plastic), but still hold their shape and easily scoop up food. That isn't always an easy feature to find. Just fyi, Amazon sells theOXO Tot Feeding Spoon Set, Green--and all the components of this set, actually--separately, too, and in different colors.The bib with the \"bowl\" at the bottom is handy. For some reason, however, my kids have never taken to wearing this bib design, and even though I'm sure a bib like this would make clean-up easier for me, I haven't pushed the issue. I do like that OXO's bib is slightly smaller than theBABYBJORN Soft Bib, Yellow, but that means it will probably work best for younger children.The snack cup, freezer tray, blocks freezer storage containers, and sippy cup are all functional and useful. I really like the flexibility of the snack cup's top coupled with its ability to keep small snacks inside the container. In other words, snacks are contained but very easily accessible to little hands. I might even like this cup better than my other favoriteMunchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Vary.The freezer tray is great for storing homemade baby food. The lid is so easy to slide on and off, and, of course, the frozen food just pops right out of the tray when you are ready to heat it up. I'm not 100% sold on using the blocks freezer storage containers for frozen baby food, though. I know the product is BPA-free, but I just don't like heating up food in plastic containers--and the food, once frozen, is very difficult to remove from the containers. I will probably just use the blocks containers as small, on-the-go snack holders, honestly.Last, the sippy cup is pretty great. If you hold it upside down, it will leak, which I know bothers some people. I don't happen to mind a little drippage, as it means my kid can easily get liquid through the spout without resorting to biting. (Important for breastfeeding!) I also like that the cup is easy to hold and can be switched to a training drinking cup as my child gets older.Ultimately, this is a nice set and there is no doubt it will get a ton of use. My only wish is that Amazon carried it in different colors, as the green color is okay but not my favorite.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice beginner set.", "unixReviewTime": 1393718400, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2014"},

As a new mom, I hate receiving gifts that is loaded with other people's ideological suggestion: like I should be breast feeding instead of giving formula, use organic cotton cloth diapers instead of using disposables, I should be doing this versus that... So from that perspective, the food containers and food feeding tray could be conveying something to your gift recipient that you are intending or not. Just thought I'd point it out.Aside from that, each piece is quality made, thoughtfully designed, useful, and will transition as your baby grows.Food containers-they are the smaller 2 oz ones. When babies first start on solids, they don't eat much. But as they get older, the 2 oz. portions will be too small. That's ok. You can put all sorts of thing in the containers. Use them to pack snacks to go. I put pacifiers in mine to keep them clean in the diaper bag.Food/icecube tray-has a lid to keep contents from touching stuff in your freezer. It is not air tight thus not intended for long term storage. Once food is frozen, transfer them into the containers. Once you grow out of this, yes...you can use this as an ice cube tray, probably sort your pills with it, too.Spoons-my favorite item of the bundle. The spoons are just so wonderfully designed. They are a milliion times easier to use than other spoons. Sturdy, wash up great. Picks up just the right amout of food. The silicon is so soft and smooth. I just the edges to easily squeegee the mess off my baby's face.Sippy cup- Nice as far as sippy cups go. I prefer Avent though.Snack cup- Very useful. I love the design of the soft cap/opening.Bib-Well made and high quality materials. But I don't use it. Too heavy and rubbery. I prefer another brand.I did the caluculation and you can buy each of these items from Amazon today, separately, and the total would be about $1 dollar less than this set.

It would make a great shower gift.  However, we've found that the sippy cup valve doesn't stay in - maybe it's a defective one, but it's been frustrating.  We're using it as a toddler cup, though, and my granddaughter loves it!  The spoons are the absolute best we've found - and we've bought a lot of them over the past 6 years!!The bib - I have to say that the bibs with the big plastic pockets are the BEST at keeping your child's clothes clean!  I've been buying the Baby Bjorn ones, but find that the kids don't like that stiff plastic around their necks, and it really rubs under the chin of a smaller child.  So Oxo has solved this problem by keeping the important part - the great pocket to catch the food - and making the top part a different material.  NOW we have the perfect bib for a messy eater!!The snack cup has some problems - it's great that it has a lid, but we find that the child has trouble getting their hand out of the cup, since the plastic flaps are rigid and not at all flexible.  I was sad about this one.If you're interested in making your own baby food, the small 2 ounce containers and the ice cube tray are great products!  Actually you could use the small containers for lots of things, not just baby food.  And since many moms freeze baby's food in ice cube trays, the COVER for the ice cube tray is a GREAT addition.

If you're looking for the best items or most budget-friendly ensemble, you can do better. It's hard to say what the best version of any item is, because as with most baby products, the &#34;best&#34; is whichever baby prefers. These are all strong exemplars, but most are not my favorites.The exception, for me, is definitely the travel bib: this is a favorite, or nearly so. We don't use this bib at home, because it takes a while to dry, but it's a standard part of my diaper bag, and I'm always grateful to have it. It rolls up very compactly and the little snap keeps it from messing up the other items. The material, once wet, does take time to air dry. In general, I prefer the Bumkins Superbibs, but I appreciate the snap here. This has a silicone pocket at the bottom which is a bit better at catching fallout than the Bumkins or other flat pocketed bibs. I prefer this to the Baby Bjorn bibs, as it rolls up. Also, my son hates the Baby Bjorn bibs, although clearly many parents and babies are happy with them. This is a great alternative if you like the sturdy pocket but want a softer bib.The containers here are very small: 1/4 cup. This is great if you're making baby food or decanting from larger containers (applesauce, yogurt), and later useful for storing Cheerios, etc., in a go bag. They are very leak-proof and can also be repurposed for sauces or salad dressing for lunches.Sippy cup is hit and miss. My son likes drinking from this. He can drink from it without much difficulty, and he really likes the shape of the (removable) handles. The valve, when in place, does a great job of preventing leaks. However, the valve tends to fall off more than any other sippy cup (this never happens with the Playtex cups). This is a big annoyance, my son ends up drenched in water/milk.The snack catcher is useful and keeps snacks from falling out when dropped. However, the large flaps make it easier for my son to dump everything onto the floor. I prefer Munchkin, with more small flaps.The spoons are nicely weighted, very solid. We didnt' use them because my son is past purees. This is for spoon-fed babies, not self-feeding. I don't think we would have cared for them, though, due to the very deep/curved shape of the spoon's bowl. We preferred Munchkin here, also.Freezer tray works great,and the lid is very easy to slide on. It's just secure enough to stay in place without causing a shake/spill to snap it together. The shape is very easy to pop the frozen food out of. If you are making a lot of food, this is a great feature to have.

Great gift for a baby shower, yes, but tell the mom-to-be that she can stash it for at least 6 months.  Big props to Oxo for choosing the gender-neutral green and making it a nice shade too. As for useability, let's go through all the items.-Freezer tray and storage cubes: These are the stars of the set -- which I say because I found it easier to make all my own food while my son was starting solids. 2 oz. is the perfect serving size, and any pureed food frozen into cubes makes life so much easier (Protip: yes, you can even puree a poached chicken breast and freeze it in perfect-serving cubes!) for serving, combining, and letting baby discover their tastebuds. The storage cubes are elegant and pretty leakproof -- they have a great second life as snack containers for the inevitable toddler you will soon have. Take note, you parents who decide to skip the freezer tray and go straight to pre-packaged squishy pouches.-Snack cup: See previous comment about the storage cubes--honestly, they are better at snack portage & consumption. This cup, while great in theory, is seriously the most frustrating cup we have in the arsenal, although this could be less so for a younger child.  My 2-yr-old son's hands get stuck in the opening; food is difficult to remove, and having only one handle on the side makes it really hard for a toddler to manipulate the cup him/herself. Honestly, this cup works best as an unbreakable mini-mug for my son to have &#34;tea&#34; from in the morning &#34;just like mommy&#34; with her ceramic mug.-Pair of spoons: Brilliant design for babies starting solids.  Silicone covers are great and the narrow bowl is good for the tiny mouth. Handle is long enough for actual parent control.-Bib: The roll-up feature makes this a good &#34;spare&#34; bib to always keep in the diaper bag.

I wasn't expecting to have my Grandchild living with me since birth and I had to make some drastic changes, one of which was to make LOTS of room in my kitchen for bottles, feeding utensils, bottle sanitizers, and the like.  Since my kids were grown I had downsized and now have a much smaller kitchen.  I was always looking for a place to store \"that thing\" while \"this thing\" was in use.  Now that my Grandchild no longer lives with me full time  all the larger items are no longer needed.  I just needed a few items to use while my Grandchild visits.  This is the perfect solution to Grandparents who need the same items as New Parents without having to set aside one-half the kitchen while the little one visits.My favourite items and the two I use the most are the wipes dispenser and the mini bottle rack.Wipes Dispenser-I put the wipes dispenser in my purse about 3 weeks ago.  When I came back home I forgot to take the dispenser out and put it up.  I pulled it out yesterday and opened it to throw away the wipes that I had forgotten expecting them to be dried out, like they are with the smaller wipes containers,  but there was no need as the wipes were still moist and the container had not leaked any liquid into my bag.  The seal on this container works really well.Bottle Drying Rack-I love that the brush comes apart and attaches to a special plastic piece to hold in place and then the rack closes up for storage.  I have this one at home to use with my Grandson BUT I am going to purchase another one to keep at the office.  It is the perfect size to keep on your desk to allow my cups, glass, sandwich container or soup bowl to dry.  After the dishes are dry, it folds up, snaps closed and goes into my desk drawer until I need it again.Sippy Cup and Snack Container-Perfect for little hands to drink from or grab a cookie or cereal from without spilling the entire contents of the cup or bowl.  The handles are ergonomic and little hands have no trouble holding onto it.The spoon has a storage case similar to those used with a thermometer.  Much easier to feed baby in a restaurant with a small spoon than the adult sized and it stays clean until ready to use.I don't use the stroller bag attachment yet as I'm not using a stroller too much right now.  When he gets older this will be handy holding shopping bags.As for storage of the items-I picked up a plastic storage box with lid from a local store, one just a little larger than the shoebox size, and everything fits into it perfectly and stores in the cabinet above my refrigerator until my little man visits again.While I still think this is perfect for travel and for new parents while on the road, I think it's a perfect fit for GrandMa's kitchen.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great For Grandparents House", "unixReviewTime": 1397520000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2014"},

Its kind of a weird shape and wasn't sure about it to begin with, but it has quickly turned into my favorite spoon. Its just the right size, shaped well and the material reminds me of silicon (not sure what it is...kind of like a cooking spatula). The little wipes container is also great and is just the right size to throw in your bag or purse.The okay: The sippy cup. Oh, how I want to love the sippy cup...and in some ways I do. The valve system is great -- when it works. However, many times I find the valve floating in the water and the sippy cup contents dripping on the floor. No matter what I do to that valve system it seems to find a way to pop out and that is why I can't call it good.  The snack cup. This is a pretty cheaply made little cup that does not feel too durable and frankly doesn't work all that well. The opening is difficult for my little ones to use so we end up taking the top off, whereby it simply becomes a bowl.The unknowns: The hook. I actually haven't used the hook. I put it on my stroller hoping for a chance to use it, but I just haven't. Its just not something I need or will use.  The bottle brush and drying rack. This part seems well thought out. The brush comes apart and neatly fits in the rack, which closes up. Problem is that I don't use bottles, so I really don't have a need for it.Overall, a cute set but I wouldn't buy it as a gift, especially considering the price tag.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "mixed bag", "unixReviewTime": 1400112000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2014"},

This gift bundle is ideal for a new mom, or for a baby who travels.  From the sitter's house tomgrandma's, or for when you travel with your little one, this set is a must.  Everything is compact and easy to clean and pack.  I love the white and green colors.  Everything is coordinated.The spoon is easy to use.  Baby is provided with a soft utensil and it is a convenient shape for you to hold.  I do notice that too much food will slide off the edges.  This could make feeding messier than normal.  The case is sleek and fits into the smallest of diaper bag compartments.The portable wipe compartment is small, very small.  If your baby is messy, or requieres many changes this may be too small.  But for shopping or a day at the sitter's it will do fine.  The case is thin and slips perfectly into a purse or diaper bag.  The drying rack is similar: small and easy to pack.  The brush is easy to put together.  The bristles are quality.  It is all plastic and very durable.The hook is not something I would buy alone, but as part of the bundle it is a nice addition.The cup and snack bowl really make this set.  The sip cup's handle can be removed.  The sippy spout can be replaced with a slotted lid to make the transition to cup drinking easier, and cleaner.  The clear plastic lid allows water to flow, but if baby throws it, the liquid will not fly everywhere!  You can remove the lid and have a regular cup.  The snack bowl has a lid to keep the contents clean.  The handle makes holding easier.  The flexible rubber allows baby's hand to move through easily to retrieve snacks.  A greedy hand won't be able to get out all the snacks, so this also encourages slow eating!Overall I think all the products are wonderfully designed.  They are easy to clean, store, pack, and use.

Standard high quality oxo, love that it comes in a case for keeping it clean on the way there, and keeping the dirty from getting on everything else on the way home.- Stroller Hook.  Haven't used it much but a nice way to hook your diaper bag, or shopping bags to your stroller.- Portable Wipes Container.  Simple, wipes come out nicely, hooks on a bag/stroller/etc for easy access.- Food Cup.  Has a handle for easy holding, top that prevents them from dumping our their cup of cheerios across your floor/car/etc.  My son did find this somewhat annoying, but I think it's better than competing snack cups with tops like this.- Portable Drying Rack.  Very small portable size, brush that comes apart and fits in the case perfectly.  Such a small little item that makes traveling someplace that much easier.- Drink Cup. This might be one of our favorite OXO tot items.  Has lids that change out, from standard sippy cup which is near leakproof, to a lid that has multiple holes to simulate drinking like a normal cup, but slows down the liquid a bit.  Handles come up from the bottom, and make this super easy to hold for the kid.The good news is that there is nothing that is bad in this kit, and you'll probably end up using most of these.  Buying the set essentially gives you the value of getting some of them 'free', but you can purchase all or some of these separately (and allows you to change up the color) as well.

For example, there is a sippy cup and a traveling snack canister, neither of which will really be used until a child is about a year old, yet there is also a traveling bottle cleaning kit that has a brush and a drying rack. It seems a little incongruous, because most kids aren&#8217;t drinking so much formula or breast milk at that age that you&#8217;d need to carry around your own personal drying rack and cleaning brush. Surely that can wait until you arrive home?I absolutely adore the traveling baby wipe dispenser, so much so that I purchased a second one so I can keep one in my car, and one in the stroller. I love that I don&#8217;t have to keep buying little disposable travel packs of wipes, or keep some huge thing of wipes that is constantly drying up in my vehicle. That&#8217;s a product that is useful from day one.I also really appreciated the little oxo spoon. It doesn&#8217;t hold much food at all, so is perfect for baby&#8217;s first meals from about age 6 months to nine months or a year.The sippy cup and snack dispenser are very well designed. The snack dispenser has little flaps to keep the fruit or whatever you put in there from rolling all over the floor if the baby bangs it against something or drops it. It won&#8217;t keep all of them from rolling out, but it does a pretty good job. That said, I kind of wish the sippy cup were made of glass or stainless steel so that I would feel comfortable letting baby drink things from it over a more extended period of time. I&#8217;m not that big on drinking from plastic containers.I also liked the stroller hook, which allowed me to run out to the co-op and pick up a few groceries while on the walk with baby, and bring them home easily. While some groceries fit underneath the baby seat, it&#8217;s nice to have the option to buy more than just milk and eggs.I think the baby drying rack and bottle brush is the one thing that I wasn&#8217;t too keen on. I guess I just didn&#8217;t really see the point. If I&#8217;m traveling, I bring enough bottles for the duration of the trip, and when I get home I clean them. Maybe if you go on a lot of overnight trips, this would be more useful. I did appreciate that the brush handle comes off so that you can fit the brush and handle inside the drying rack. But I guess I stick close enough to home that to me this seemed a little silly.Overall, oxo makes really innovative products and these baby products are no exception. That said, I would check the price carefully and make sure that you&#8217;re actually getting a deal by buying all of these things at once, because you may not want or need all of them, and perhaps you&#8217;ll save money just buying the few things you will need.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Some of these items hit the mark, and some not so much", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"},

You can use it as a place for your toddler to hang on to when you take the little one for walks. Or you can use it as a hook to put shopping bags on. The grip is strong and it attaches easily to the stroller.The travel spoon is durable, easy to clean, and soft on a babys mouth. The case keeps it clean in a diaper bag and then keeps the diaper bag clean when you put the dirty spoon back inside when you are done with it.The sippy cup works nicely for toddlers. It is hard spout so they cannot chew a hole in the spout. It is leak proof and durable. Dishwasher safe. The handles are slightly rubberized to make griping the cup really easy for messy hands. The extra lid is great for training toddlers to drink from a big kid cup. It allows them to go the motions, without making an awful mess.The wipes container is easy to refill, easy to dispense and easy to attach to the diaper bag. I have no trouble finding it in my bag and it has never leaked. I do find that if it isn't full, the wipes do dry out though.The snack cup is pretty standard. Dishwasher safe. Again there is a rubberized grip to make it easy for kids to grab on to. Larger crackers and smaller cereal both were easily eaten out of this cup by my preschooler.The travel dishwashing set is the best. I use this as my main cleaning system at home. My baby only occasionally gets a bottle and it is nice to have this folded in the cabinet ready to use when it is time to wash a bottle, a pacifier, or anything else small. I pack it away when I don't need it, and then it comes out, pops together and works amazingly well when I do need it. The entire thing is dishwasher safe, so when I have used it a few times I do throw it in the dishwasher to disinfect it. An amazing feature is the locking nipple brush. I had problems with other bottle brushes not staying together, or worse, my curious preschooler sticking his finger in the hole on the bottom of the brush.

They're all nice items on their own but not everyone is going to need each one of these items.  Of the six items in this set there are only three that I can say I think are particularly useful for our needs.I really like the handle that straps onto the stroller to hold bags and things of that nature.  It's great for shopping or toting stuff to the soccer field.  I also like that this handle can be used for an older child to hold onto when you're pusing the stroller.I really like the feeding spoon with the convenient plastic travel case.  Years ago [12 years to be exact] we brought a travel case from The First Years for baby spoons.  It held four spoons but it isn't very compact and I got to the point where I opted to bring a spoon in a plastic baggie rather than tote the spoon around in the case.  This spoon and travel case can be easily slipped into a diaper bag or purse.The fold up drying rack is nice for visits to the grandparents or vacations.  It's conveneint and will ensure that you have what you need to keep baby's bottles, pacifiers and even pump accessories nice and clean while you're away from home.The snack cup is nice and has a snap on lid which is great.  I've tried a lot of different snack cups in the past for my kids and they always eneded up dumping crumbs in my bag because they didn't have a lid.  But this is an item that I feel isn't exactly an essential.  Eventually your little one will figure out how to dump the contents of the cup despite the flaps that are supposed to prevent spills.The wipes container is just bulky.  It has a nice loop for hooking it onto the handle of a stroller, but it's added bulk that I don't care to tote around.  I opt to put a stack of wipes in a zip lock bag which is more compact, keeps the wipes moist and easier to carry.Of all the items in this set I like the sippy cup the least.  My toddler didn't care for the spout at all.  Since she's nearly 2 1/2 we also tried the big kid lid.  She didn't like that either.

Some of these items are awesome, and others.... not so much!The sippy cup does grow with your child.  It has the traditional baby sippy cup pieces and then converts to the toddler cup.  Toddlers can learn to drink from a &#34;real&#34; cup without TOO much spillage.  My 3 year old granddaughter loves it!  However, we find that the valve in the sippy cup does not stay in and always falls into the drink, so we don't use it in baby mode anymore.The spoon in the case - you DEFINITELY need to buy more of these spoons.  We have tried MANY different spoons and these are our favorites, after many babies in the last 6 years!  The case is great - keeps the spoon germ-free.The stroller hook can hold a ton of bags - this is a great product, as is the wipes container.  Most wipes containers are flimsier - great job on this one, Oxo!The drying rack and bottle brush is great, and the brush is in two pieces so it comes apart easy for travel.I'm very disappointed in the snack cup.  The plastic flaps that are on the top are too rigid and not flexible!  When the child reaches in for a snack, it's hard for them to get their hand out!

Some of these items are very useful, some not so much, and some I haven't yet used and don't think they are particularly useful at all.1) The Cup.I like this cup a lot.  It is a good training cup for a toddler sitting at at able and starting to learn to drink from a glass.  The top has several cut out holes around the rim, so the toddler gets used to sipping from an open cup.  However, it is NOT spill proof.  There is also a top that is (mostly) spill proof that can be used as a traditional sippy until your child is ready for to start learning to drink from a glass.2) The spoon.This is a nice soft-tipped spoon, principally to be used for feeding infant children.  My son is beyond this stage, but this seemed like a good spoon generally.  I like the carrying case, although, honestly, it's just something extra to clean.  A plastic bag works just as well, and that you can just throw away.3) The stroller hook.Unnecessary.  I use a diaper bag that can be hooked around my stroller's handles, which keeps my belongings more secure and less likelty to make the stroller lobsided in weight or to get caught in the wheels.4) travel bottle brushUnnecessary.  Seriously, do you really have a great need to wash bottles when you're not at home?  I don't get this product at all.5) Snack container.As good as the Munchkin brand I see most commonly.  But better, because this has a top, which keeps all those cheerios from filling the bottom of my diaper bag.6) Wipes container.This wipes container keeps wipes wet, better than the Huggies-brand refill container I also have.  It's also harder for my toddler to open and then just take all the wipes out, too.So that it.

The design is generally quite good.The hook has a velcro attachment to attach to strollers and you can use it to hang stuff, like diaper or shopping bags. Nothing much else to say about it: it's sturdy and won't fall off.The cup is pretty standard with clear parts to see inside from top, sides, and bottom. It has ml and fl oz markings, large handles, and two interchangeable lids (one anti spill, one for regular drinking). BPA free.The spoon has a soft rubber cover over the business end and a plastic handle. It's metal-backed and has a little case to keep it clean. The scoop is thin and contoured.The drying rack is easily the largest item here, has a fold-up design, and has spokes for placing nipples and such. It's good enough to dry a few bottles or other similar items out, and has spots to attach the brush and cleaner. These two items can also screw together to lengthen the brush handle. No complaints about these items, they work well.The snack cup is for non-liquid food, and has a flexible rubber flap top for easy access. It will likely retain most of its contents if dropped, but it's not exactly spill proof when being used. The main advantage of this item is if the baby drops it from their high chair it won't make as big a mess.The wipes case is pretty standard, enough to hold a small stack of wipes.

It is a soft, comfortable sleeper for your infant and provides you with easy-access at o&#8217;dark-thirty when you are on diaper duty.Made of 100% cotton knit, the well-constructed wearable blanket is thoughtfully designed.  The seams are finished cleanly.  The manufacturer has used what appears to be cotton-covered thread so that there are no jagged, invisible thread ends that might potentially scratch delicate skin.  Stitching is smooth and even.  A bias-tape made of the same knit fabric used in the wearable blanket&#8217;s body is used around the neckline.  Inside the wearable blanket, a placket made of the same knit fabric covers the zipper and zipper tape; this helps prevent any irritation of the infant&#8217;s skin.A nylon zipper extends from the neck down the body of the &#8220;Summer Infant ComfortMe Wearable Blanket&#8221; and completely across the bottom.  This allows easy access when having to change a diaper in the wee hours of the morning.  It also helps prevent waking your little one because of the amount of handling required with redressing them in a footed sleeper.Instead of constricting fitted sleeves, the wearable blanket has dolman-style sleeves that allow greater freedom of movement.  An approximate 1 &#8221; seam in the underarm area helps prevent your little one extracting her arms out of the sleeve.The one weak aspect of the &#8220;Summer Infant ComfortMe Wearable Blanket&#8217;s&#8221; construction is the snap tab closure located at the top opening.  The snap is very difficult to open and close; the strain on the fabric is significant.  During middle-of-the-night diaper changing, the snap can be frustrating when you have to undo the wearable blanket.  Even though the manufacturer has reinforced the body of the wearable blanket with extra layers of fabric at the snap, the fabric may tear from the strain of opening the snap.

In fact, I stopped using my Halo sacks after I got these.PROS:1. These have sleeves. Well, sort of. The sleeves are more like wings but they cover your baby's arms and stay in place. I can't imagine it being very comfortable sleeping snuggly in a sack but having cold arms. That's the problem with Halo in my opinion. Plus the sleeves and the shape of this sack makes your little one look he/she has those winged sky diving/gliding suits on. Adorable!2. These have two way zippers. Someone really put some thought into the design on this. I love the two way zippers. The zipper is always hooked. You just zip in one of the directions. If you zip from the shoulder down, the sack opens so you can easily put this on or take this off. If you zip from the bottom up, then just the bottom opens for diaper changes, minimizing baby's exposure to cold drafts. Halo has a similar feature with their one way zippers going from chin to feet so that you can open it from the bottom for diaper changes. But with a squirmy and sometimes angry baby who doesn't want to go down for a nap, or if you only have one hand to operate the zipper, trying to hook the zipper pin into the zipper slider/pull can be a struggle. The two way zippers eliminate that.3. Fold-over fabric tab with a snap button on the shoulder covers the exposed zipper so it doesn't scratch or irritate baby's face.4. Sturdy construction and materials. I put my girl in this sack for all naps and every night for the last month and wash once or twice a week and they are going strong and getting softer.5. Comes in many sizes and fun/adorable colors and prints.CONS:1. 100% cotton jersey is not as smooth and soft as Halo's cotton jersey material. Halo's material just feel more luxurious. But the material of the Summer Infant blanket does get softer with washing and use.2. Sizes run a little smaller that Halo. I got the large in these for my girl who is 9 months and 18 pounds. She is 27 inches tall. And I feel like there is not much room to grow lengthwise, even though Summer Infant says the large size is for babies 9-12 months weighing 18-24 pounds. Compared to the Halo sacks, she is just starting to grow out of the Medium size. I'd say a large in the Summer Infant wearable blanket is shorter in length (by about 2 inches) than a medium Halo sleep sack.3. Arm holes can be bit tight. I have 4 of these sacks in different prints and only the Safari print has this problem. Not a big deal because the jersey stretches. Also, if you sew, you can undo the factory stitches and put in a couple of your own further down to make the arm holes bigger if this happens to you.I actually prefer these over my Halo sacks which I have stopped using since I got these. But because the size runs smaller than Halo (I think large is the biggest size) my girl will outgrow these soon before she is 12 months old, and we will likely have to go back to Halo. I hope they will expand their sizing and use nicer cotton. If they did, then these would be way better than Halo. For now, they both have their pros and cons. But I think these are just a bit better than the Halo sleep sacks.I gave it 5 stars but it's really 4.5. But I wouldn't hesitate to give this a 5 if they just make more sizes and use nicer cotton. Compared to Halo which I would give 3.5 or 4. So I would recommend this product if you are considering it.

In fact, I stopped using my Halo sacks after I got these.PROS:1. These have sleeves. Well, sort of. The sleeves are more like wings but they cover your baby's arms and stay in place. I can't imagine it being very comfortable sleeping snuggly in a sack but having cold arms. That's the problem with Halo in my opinion. Plus the sleeves and the shape of this sack makes your little one look he/she has those winged sky diving/gliding suits on. Adorable!2. These have two way zippers. Someone really put some thought into the design on this. I love the two way zippers. The zipper is always hooked. You just zip in one of the directions. If you zip from the shoulder down, the sack opens so you can easily put this on or take this off. If you zip from the bottom up, then just the bottom opens for diaper changes, minimizing baby's exposure to cold drafts. Halo has a similar feature with their one way zippers going from chin to feet so that you can open it from the bottom for diaper changes. But with a squirmy and sometimes angry baby who doesn't want to go down for a nap, or if you only have one hand to operate the zipper, trying to hook the zipper pin into the zipper slider/pull can be a struggle. The two way zippers eliminates that.3. Fold-over fabric tab with a snap button on the shoulder covers the exposed zipper so it doesn't scratch or irritate baby's face.4. Sturdy construction and materials. I put my girl in this sack for all naps and every night for the last month and wash once or twice a week and they are going strong and getting softer.5. Comes in many sizes and fun/adorable colors and prints.CONS:1. 100% cotton jersey is not as smooth and soft as Halo's cotton jersey material. Halo's material just feel more luxurious. But the material of the Summer Infant blanket does get softer with washing and use.2. Sizes run a little smaller that Halo. I got the large in these for my girl who is 9 months and 18 pounds. She is 27 inches tall. And I feel like there is not much room to grow lengthwise, even though Summer Infant says the large size is for babies 9-12 months weighing 18-24 pounds. Compared to the Halo sacks, she is just starting to grow out of the Medium size. I'd say a large in the Summer Infant wearable blanket is shorter in length (by about 2 inches)than a medium Halo sleep sack.3. Arm holes can be bit tight. I have 4 of these sacks in different prints and only the Safari print has this problem. Not a big deal because the jersey stretches. Also, if you sew, you can undo the factory stitches and put in a couple of your own further down to make the arm holes bigger if this happens to you.I actually prefer these over my Halo sacks which I have stopped using since I got these. But because the size runs smaller than Halo (I think large is the biggest size) my girl will outgrow these soon before she is 12 months old, and we will likely have to go back to Halo. I hope they will expand their sizing and use nicer cotton. If they did, then these would be way better than Halo. For now, they both have their pros and cons. But I think these are just a bit better than the Halo sleep sacks.I gave it 5 stars but it's really 4.5. But I wouldn't hesitate to give this a 5 if they just make more sizes and use nicer cotton. Compared to Halo which I would give 3.5 or 4. So I would recommend this product if you are considering it.

This is for older babies that don't care for swaddling as much anymore, but it's before they can be put down with an actual blanket.Both the SwaddleMe and ComfortMe wearable blankets have a zipper on the bottom, which is much easier than the Halo Sleepsack, although if it's a very messy diaper, you're going to throw it in the wash anyway,  = )All three wearable blankets are good to use, especially to prevent chills with AC, etc., but the WrapSack seems the most convertible and all-around useful if you want to try one.

Zipper bottom means you can change the diaper without overly disturbing baby, although we would always use this with a normal sleeper set, so that would also still need to be removed for changing.  The picture shows a baby standing in this, but I don't think the design is ideal for baby that are in the standing stage, as it would be hard for baby to successfully stand and not fall, however, it's great until that point.

It may be helpful to note that for the other brands, size medium fits up to 24 lbs and is comparable to ComfortMe large. All three work well for us. The main difference is since we have the light weight single-layer style from aden+anais, I use that over slightly thicker pajamas.

When I received it, it was very simple to set up. I had it up within minutes. It took longer to get it out of the box. I loved the size of the monitor and also loved that the camera had an extra long power cord. I have found a lot of cameras have short cords and this one is longer. Both power cords are marked with either a monitor or camera on the back of the power adapter so you know which one to use, literally idiot proof.The camera to me has a rather large footprint and I feel very limited angles. It only goes up and down and left and right. I can never get a great view and have to adjust it a lot. The camera itself has decent infrared.The monitor, I have such a love hate relationship with it. It is very basic. It you are wanting something with bells and whistles, keep looking, it is very basic. One thing I did love about this monitor over all the others I have owned it you do not have to power it down and back up to see the screen. It has a button on the top you can hit that puts it is standby mode. This feature was probably one of the best things they made on it. However, for being a wide angle camera and a really large screen size, I do not feel I am getting a decent area. It seems very limited due to the camera and angels. The colors are not that great and as far as I can tell you can only turn the brightness up and down. It seems to have a purple hue to it which I find annoying. It does have a very stable kickstand on the back which is nice that you do not have to worry about it falling over if moving from room to room.

My toddler daughter will be leaving her room on the camera but yet she is standing next to me in the kitchen. It is a very significant lag, too much of a lag for parents to be concerned about their little ones. It also will freeze up at times.

This monitor from Summer Infant seemed like it had the potential to be a really good monitor based on the product description, but in reality, it ended up being our least favorite of the four video monitors we've used.What I like about this monitor is the fact that the infared lights don't have a bright red or fuschia glow like the monitors from The First Years that we have reviewed in the past.

First off, the camera unit needs a bit more flexibility for getting the angle just right.  It can only tilt up and down and turn from side to side.  The monitors that we have that are on a ball pivot allow us to get a much better angle of our baby's crib.  This monitor just doesn't give us the angle we're looking for.  The package boasts that this monitor has a wide angle view but it really isn't much wider than other video monitors.  I also don't like that the zoom feature doesn't allow you to navigate around the way the video monitors from The First Years and Samsung do.  It gives the impression of being poorly designed.  The night time view is quite bad.  In fact, it's the worst I've seen out of the four monitors we've had and that's saying a lot considering the one montior from The First Years (Crisp and Clear) that we have has only a 2 inch screen with a pretty grainy picture that offers more night time clarity.In all honesty, I'd stay away from this monitor.

This annoys me- Camera does not turn side to side &#8211; made getting a good view of the crib slightly difficult- No temperature gaugeI know my Cons list is a little picky, but I think that having a temperature gauge on the baby monitor should be something that all baby monitors have.  This is my third baby monitor.  I believe that I like this one the most out of the 3 that I&#8217;ve tried;  A V-Tech monitor (which is a great monitor for the price) and a Levana monitor (for the price, not so much).Once the monitor is off of the charger, the monitor goes into screen saving mode after about 5 minutes &#8211; you still get audit, but the picture goes black.  You can hit the screen button to make the image re-appear, but that does really annoy me.  I want the picture to be constantly on the video monitor.  If a customer didn&#8217;t want a screen to look at, they would have purchased an audio-only monitor.  But that&#8217;s just my gripe.  But I understand why Summer Infant decided to create the screen saving mode &#8211; because the battery is absolutely TERRIBLE when the screen is on non-stop.  It lasts me for maybe an hour to an hour and a half.  I can&#8217;t watch a movie in the living room without the battery dying on me.  Not cool.Other than those main things, I do like this monitor.  I like that it came with a VERY long cord for the camera, as well as mounting tacks.  I was able to mount my camera on the wall by the window and thread the wire down the interior of the window frame with the cord holders.  It looks great and you can&#8217;t even tell that there is a wire coming down the wall!  I like good aesthetics &#61514;Overall, I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a decent baby monitor.  I like it and I&#8217;m using it as my primary baby monitor at the moment, so I&#8217;m getting great use out of it.  The range is nice and I have yet to lose the signal, which is a huge plus for me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great monitor - Basic Video Monitor with Some Features Lacking", "unixReviewTime": 1400025600, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2014"},

I can compare this one to the Motorola MBP36 and I like this one better because the video quality is so much better on this one.  I thought the MBP36 was good until I got this one, then it was absolutely no contest.  In fact, I wish I could return the MBP36.  The MBP36 is good because you can pan the camera remotely using the controls on the monitor and I like that the buttons on the monitor is on the face and not on the edges because that makes it so you are not constantly accidentally pushing buttons when you're carrying it, but that's it.  In video quality, this one wins hands down and since that's the most important part - I prefer this one.  The wide angle is nice because you can see a greater area, but then you're not getting a close up.  There's a zoom feature which kind of makes up for it but if you are only using this to point into one specific area and want to see like your baby breathing - you may want to get the non-wide  angle version of this baby monitor.  This one is great if you want to monitor the whole crib or a whole room.  If your baby is very mobile, this would be your best choice.  The camera is static (doesn't pan), but you won't need it to because you can set it up so it shows you the whole room at once.What could be improved:1. Battery life of the monitor - it only lasts a few hours of continuous use.  The charger does have an extra long cable, but it would be nice if the battery life was better.2.  The buttons are all along the edges of the monitor - this is nice because you get a very nice big viewing screen, but not so nice because you're constantly accidentally hitting buttons on the thing when you're carring it around.3.  Picture quality - Yes, it's much better video quality than the Motorola MBP36 and it's good enough that you can easily see your baby breathing, but it could always be better....if we're being greedy.What is great:1.  Great wide screen so you can see an entire room in one shot.  You don't need it to pan.  Screen size is bigger and better than the MBP362.  Great video quality - you can easily watch your baby breathing3.  Great night vision  - you can easily watch baby breathing4.  Very reliable5.  Excellent portability - I have a 1500 sq ft house on a half acre lot and I'm able to monitor the baby from pretty much my entire property.  So everywhere in the house and out in the yard as well.  Excellent.  It beats the Motorola MBP36 in this area as well.6.  Has an internal antenna which is way nicer than the externa antenna of the Motorola MBP36 - while still having better connection.7.  The stand is better and sturdier on the monitor than the MBP368.  Pretty much everything you need to monitor your baby.9.  The monitor and camera can be closer together before you get feedback - basically, just as long as they are at least 2 feet apart, you won't have feedback issues.  Not like the MBP36 which gets feedback if they are in the same room.  This is especially important if you're trying to adjust the placement of the camera while looking at the monitor.  Or - if you rig this up in your car to use as a car baby monitor (which I did).  I would recommend using the non-wide screen version if using in the car, but this one would work as well.  I love using this in the car because 1.  It's way better than trying to rig up a bunch of mirrors to monitor my baby in her rear facing car seat.  2.  You can't see the baby with mirrors if driving at night - but you can with this monitor because of the night vision.  3.  With the zoom feature, you can easily see baby breathing in her car seat - this is especially important with the rise in incidents where babies stop breathing in their car seats.  I am able to drive with confidence and not have to worry because I can totally see her face and chest and know everything is okay.  I have the monitor mounted on my dash with a GPS monitor that accepts a 5&#34; screen.10.  Durability - I've been using this in all different capacities, every day for the past 2 months and it's been going strong.  I've dropped the monitor a few times and it's gotten scuffed on the edges, but still working great.Great product that I use on a daily basis and am extremely happy with.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better video than the Motorola MBP36", "unixReviewTime": 1402358400, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2014"},

In general, the concept is that they're swaddles for dummies. I.e., you don't need to figure out the ridiculous trick that allows swaddling with a banal, square blanket. Instead, you can just use the velcro to turn a formless sack into its baby-straightjacket mode. For those of you without a screaming infant, that's a major plus. A priori, I kind of imagined that they would lie there and gently submit to being swaddled (especially since they're supposed to like it). But they don't. They squirm and writhe and freak out. As such, velcro is a winner. (Although it is generally a nuisance all other times&#8230;). So, the other SwaddleMe products are a big win.This one is not so much.Let me start with the most obvious failure. The zipper runs not parallel to the length of the sleep sack (which is the way to do it that makes sense, because then you can just lay your baby inside), but rather transverse (which means that you have to pull it over the baby's head, so&#8230;instant unhappiness). Ostensibly, this makes it easier to change diapers. But, as is so often the case, the distance between theory and practice is rather vast. In reality, this just makes it much much harder to get LT into the sleep sack, and results in fussing, crying, and wailing. And the baby isn't happy either. As a side note, it also doesn't really make it easier to change the child. Alone, this would make it suboptimal and undesirable.As they say, however, &#34;But wait! There's more!&#34; To wit, despite the fact that the other SwaddleMe sleep sack that we have is Small, and this one is also Small, this one fits really poorly. LT is at&#8230;the 10th percentile or something like that in weight, and 75th percentile in length. So&#8230;not a huge baby. But it's not the length that is the problem. It's the girth. When I try to velcro the swaddle, it's a little TOO straightjackety. It's a bit ridiculous to imagine that many babies are going to fit well in this thing. I understand that swaddles should be tight but this is a bit extreme, reminding me of tasteless jokes from childhood.I was truly hoping that this would be an excellent product, like the Winter SwaddleMe that we have. I was pretty disappointed.I said all of that about the small size swaddle, and I was really hoping that the larger one would be better. But it really isn't. There is no middle ground here; our baby falls squarely between the sizes, and the large SwaddleMe is too big, and doesn't effectively swaddle.In a nod to sanity and to retain my sense of composure, I did what I always do with two star products. I tossed it aside, and went and got something else. In this case, I got the Halo 100% Cotton Sleepsack Swaddle, Amazon Product: B003E6OBMA, which I would give four stars.All my other complaints about the small exist here as well.

The bib is light weight and waterproof.  It is not absorbent, but does have a pouch at the bottom to catch blobs of food that slide down the bib.  My almost 7 month old eats more and more mushy foods every day.  The bib is very big - it covers baby's entire torso, so any food blobs that don't get in his mouth or face are going to fall on the bib or the floor.  I can put it on at meal time and keep the mess off the baby.The bib is fast drying.  If the feeding is tidier, then I can wipe the bib, give it a quick wash in the sink by squishing it with soapy water, and it will dry in a few hours.  If the feeding is messier, then I throw it in the wash, because there's a chance that a quick hand wash will leave it sticky.  Most feedings, I can rinse the bib just fine and leave it for the next feeding.Even though these are pricey, they may be worth trying in your bib rotation.  With terry cloth bibs, I had to wash after one or two feedings.  With these waterproof bibs, I can get by on two bibs and doing laundry on the weekend, because the bibs don't get messy and dry quickly after a quick hand wash.

I didn't care for the stiff plastic and vinyl bibs that typically don't last more than a few months.  When I came across Bumkins super bibs I was intrigued but skeptical.  The bibs are really thin and I didn't believe that they would keep my baby's clothes protected and dry.  So I bought just one and tried it out fully expecting it to be another worthless bib.  Imagine my complete shock when this bib that was covered in runny rice cereal was completely dry on the reverse side.  My daughter's clothes were clean and dry.  I was impressed.  Even the little pocket at the bottom of this bib which catches food did it's job.  Other feeding bibs will leak from the pocket seam but not these!I honestly didn't expect these bibs to last very long.  I figured after going through the wash a few times what ever magical quality the fabric had that kept it waterproof would disappear.  After several washes I started to think that perhaps maybe I was wrong.  Now that I've had several Bumkins bibs for two years and have seen them go through the wash hundreds of times I can tell you that these bibs are awesome.  They still look new after years of use and repeated washings.  They are every bit as waterproof today as they were when I got them.  Because I have a dryer that likes to melt synthetic fibers (Thanks, Electrolux!) I have always hung these bibs to dry.  They dry in under an hour, so you could get away with only having a few of these bibs and just wash them off after baby eats and they'll be ready in time for the next meal.I'm loving all of the great Disney Bbaby designs for the Bumkins bibs.  They make an already great product even better.  These Mickey icon bibs are prefect for a little boy.  We now have a little boy on the way and I was initally disappointed that the Bumkins bibs didn't have the nicest designs for boys' bibs, but now that there are several Mickey, Monsters Inc and Winnie the Pooh designs I'm very pleased with the offerings for boys.If you buy these feeding bibs you won't be disappointed.

These are the winners, by far. I buy them for my son and I would buy them for gifts and recommend to other parents.The material is soft and our son doesn't mind wearing them at all. If anything, he gets excited because he knows it's time to eat. The material is very waterproof and air dries reasonably quickly after washing. It does not stain. The pocket is not the best because it's flat, but if you dry them inside out, the pocket will stay open enough to do its job well. Even if you forget, it's still helpful, it just might miss a little bit. On the other hand, the flexibility is a bonus if you have a shallower high chair. Our high chair tends to seal shut some of the silicone and plastic options.The Mickey print is attractive and not too aggressive, which I appreciate. My only complaint about the Bumpkins Super Bib line (and it's a very minor one that does not affect my willingness to purchase or recommend these) is the pattern selection. Many of these are a bit garish, especially in the very few gender-neutral patterns. I don't see any true gender-neutral opetions in the Disney line. These are blue, which might mean &#34;boy&#34; to you. They do offer some Dr Seuss and Keith Haring patterns, but they are very bold patterns.Our experience with other bibs:Tommy Tippee soft silicone bibs - pocket is effective at catching fallout; it stays open a bit. We appreciated that it was soft enough to roll up, but our son did not like the rubbery texture around his neck. They also stained. He did like being able to pick food out of the pocket quite easily with this bib. These would be our runners-up for daily use, but we put them away when we got enough of the Bumpkins.Baby Bjorn pocket bib - not soft at all: rigid plastic that has just a touch of flexibility. Our son hated them and cried when we tried to put it on him. Lost of parents and kids seem to love them, but they did not work for us at all. The pocket may push into the kid's stomach if they don't have a lot of room behind the tray (in which case, you might really need and want the rigid open pocket).OXO travel bib - love this for diaper bag because it rolls up and has a tab that keeps it compact. The upper material is soft and smooth, but the neck is a tad narrow and the material takes a while to dry. Pocket is silicone, stays open well. The bib is overall on the narrow side, though.No-name bib with clear pocket (generic kind you see everywhere) - Not bad but the pocket tends to stay shut, and the material is a bit stiff. The bumpkins are worth the extra buck or 2.Ikea sleeved bibs - not waterproof. Honestly, my kid is too small for them, so I can't really evaluate and compare.

The umbrella stroller is not comfortable for parent (handles too short) or child (no padding), nor does it have storage.The Kolcraft stroller came as part of the Amazon Vine program.

It folds up easily, with one hand, and has a tray for drinks for parents and kids. It reclines, which my jogging stroller does not do.Pros:- 50 # kid weight limit, which is higher than most strollers in a similar price range.- Stroller only weighs 11.8# so it's easy to load/maneuver.- Snack tray for parents AND kids.- Large storage basked underneath.- The shade extends down about the same length as pricier jogging strollers and has a plastic view hole for parents to see their kids, which comes in handy if they are asleep.- Speaking of sleeping, the stroller reclines to 3 positions.- Supposedly has front wheel shocks.- Can fold using one hand, which is awesome for plane travel.Cons:- Might be difficult for some kids to get in without detaching the snack tray. If they are strapped in the 5-point harness and with the snack tray, it can be difficult to make emergency bathroom situations.- Both the parent and child cup holders are small.- Seat cannot be detached for cleaning.- The wheels are plastic, which I think negates the concept of front wheel shocks. Rubber wheels absorb a lot more bumping than this.

With 2 grand babies (one newborn,one nearly 2 years old) , we use a very lightweight infant sized stroller for the newborn and and the larger Kolcraft for the toddler. We have another stroller which is the size of the Kolcraft but it is a pain to use.The Kolcraft is superior . We've also found it very durable, having used it on bumpy sidewalks, unexpected gravel pathways ( in the middle of otherwise smooth trails), and more. And it has enough storage space to carry gear for a toddler, newborn, and  adults, thanks to the roomy storage basket under the seat. Plus, there is both a child snack tray as well as one for parents or grandparents.More info on ease of assembly, special features, etc. :Assembly: This took me about 10 minutes but should have been quicker . I blame the extra time on my less than stellar understanding of even simple assembly directions. Yet even with my less than adept skills, I found it simple to put together. I  was  also intimidated by the prospect of adding the wheels but they too were actually easy to attach.Ease of use: If a stroller is frustrating to open and close, that is a deal breaker for me. This one takes only one hand to open and close. It opens a bit more easily than it folds but I think that is a safety feature, to ensure it doesn't collapse while a baby or toddler is in the stroller.Special features: the protective cover has a section of clear plastic so adults can see the baby or toddler without having to stop and lean over. The adult snack tray is at a very convenient height, although (like any stroller tray),  it may still be necessary to grab your water bottle or soft drink can while navigating over bumpy areas or hills. I like to use the snack area for my keys, a tube of sunscreen, or  an extra pacifier. The mesh sides of the storage basket allows it to dry quickly if it gets wet, perhaps after a sudden rain storm. We've found all parts of the stroller easy to clean, generally by simply wiping down with a moist cloth.Weight and portability:In spite of its size, the Kolcraft manages to be both durable and surprisingly light and easy to carry when folded up.

In my mind, I was immediately comparing it to ourBritax 2014 B-Agile Stroller, BlackandBaby Jogger City Mini Single Stroller, Teal/Graystrollers. This is where I was wrong. The B-Agile and City Mini are every-day utility strollers that are much more substantial, and much more expensive. In an out of context side-by-side general comparison, the Kolcraft Cloud Plus loses to these amazing strollers every time. However, rating the Cloud Plus within the context of its strengths as a low cost, light weight, travel stroller, the Cloud Plus comes up aces.Perhaps oddly, the feature that really put it in perspective for me was the one-handed standing collapse. Just imagine yourself standing in line for the tram or trolley at some theme park, when your ride arrives and chaos ensues. Typically, even with a nice one-handed collapsible stroller, you end up with a mess; a child in one hand and a stroller leaning awkwardly on your legs or laying on the ground that ends up laying or leaning in the tram or trolley, as well. The Cloud Plus pushes closed with one hand, and remains standing on all four wheels! It was this this feature that revealed to me that this stroller was designed to be on the go.Through my new eyes, I was able to assess the other strengths of this little behemoth. The stroller is light - less than twelve pounds, it has plenty of under seat storage, it comes equipped with both a child tray and a parent tray - each can cost upwards of twenty dollars to add to other models, it is surprisingly sturdy, the occupant seems reasonably comfortable, and, at its current price point of less than sixty dollars, it wouldn't bust our budget if someone walked off with it while we were riding the carousel, or feeding the giraffes or whatever.In my opinion, it might be worth it to spend the extra cash on a more comfortable and durable all-purpose, everyday use stroller.

So I ordered this one to try out.Important (to me) options:- Oversized visor - my little guy hates having the sun in his eyes, and I love that this stroller has a fold-down portion (black) that can also be pushed back into the red part of the visor.  Simple but effective.- Five point harness - did I mention little guy is squirmy?  He can get out of almost anything, but has not yet mastered evasion of the five point harness.- Nice recline - the recline is so easy, just an adjustable strap across the back that you can tighten for \"upright\" or loosen to whatever recline you desire.  (It does not go flat, but that was not a requirement for my toddler.  It does recline plenty far for him to rest comfortably when he is tired.)- Smooth ride - my biggest gripe with my full-size Graco was that it was unwieldy.  Everyone who used it commented on this - the toddler was comfortable, but maneuverability was definitely compromised!  When this Kolcraft stroller came, I took it out of the box and pushed it in circles around our kitchen (with toddler gleefully inside) - back and forth, side to side, twirl, etc.  I was amazed at how easily it handled.  A few days later, I took it out shopping and it did great navigating aisles and various surfaces.- Storage basket - definitely smaller than on my full-size, but still fits the diaper bag comfortably, or, if I left that in the the car (I don't usually have to have it along on short trips) would fit my purse with lots of room to spare.- Snack tray for rider - the cupholder definitely won't fit my little guy's go-to water bottle (Nalgene sippy) but I wouldn't have put it in there unsecured anyhow (he'd throw it).  My main reason for wanting a bar across the front was that he likes to hold onto it when he's in the seat.  So it accomplishes that purpose.  I suppose I could put snacks in the tray.  But I didn't even use the snack tray on my full-size for that purpose, so again, this one is fine.- Adult cupholder/tray - skinny cup holes...would fit a standard thin water bottle, maybe a Kleen Kanteen-sized one.  I tend to use the adult tray simply for my keys, so again, this isn't a huge issue.  Besides, the stroller is so light and easy to move, I can EASILY do it with one hand...so I can just hold my coffee, if I do happen to have some along.- Easy fold - I feel like there is a slight learning curve to the easy-fold, but that might just be that my model catches a bit.  I think this will correct as it wears in.  Mine does not stand upright by itself, but since it is stored either in my trunk (flat) or basement hall (leaning against the wall) that really doesn't make any difference one way or the other.Overall, this stroller is so lightweight that it's hard to believe it can hold up to 50lbs, but it did not \"give\" at all when I put my 30lb'er in it.  I'm curious to see how it wears, but all the seams appear to be tight, the fabric seems rugged and there is nothing wobbly about this stroller.  I am loving it, and highly recommend for the price and quality!  The take-away?  Pretty much as soon as I started pushing it around my kitchen, I told my husband we were getting rid of the full-size when it comes out of storage.

The first was a Safety 1st brand and is very similar in shape. I love how Summer has innovated on the idea by not just offering a basic infant to toddler bathtub, but by including accessories to help occupy the baby which I never had for the first.This bathtub comes with a simple-clip on toy bar with mirror. You have two attachments that hang on the clip-on bar which is a heart shape and a sun shape plastic.There are 3 stages of use for this bathtub and basically solves the problem of having to purchase multiple products throughout your baby's growth..STAGE 1: From 0 monthsIt comes with a clip-on bath sling which acts as a baby hammock. As a result it gently carries the baby on a laying down position.STAGE 2: Contoured Backrest (possibly 6 mos and up; depending on baby's size and weight)This is where you discard the sling at this point in the baby's growth, but retain the clip-on toy bar. At this stage the baby is able to sit upright on it's own and can appreciate the clip-on articles to keep her entertained.STAGE 3: TUB (up to 2 years old; depending on baby's size)You discard the clip-on bar and change the baby's position from the contoured backrest part to an upright sitting position. It now acts like a miniature tub where the length of the tub encompasses the length of the baby's legs.For our first tub, we discarded it earlier than two when our baby could comfortably not just stand but walk by himself. This way he can safely move about on the adult tub without feeling constricted. So at this point, you can use it up to stage 3 until the time you are confident enough to allow your baby to bathe in the actual tub.PROS:- Included bath sling that acts like a baby hammock- Accessories to keep baby entertained during bath time- Drain plug to safely drain water especially when using over the sink. When using over an actual tub, I just tip the whole tub over.- Soft padding on the tub.- The actual tub is made in the USA (everything else is made in China)CONS:- Not BPA-free which should be a standard for baby plastic items- One of the foam pads was not stuck together properly  and was hanging loose. I had to remove the cardboard particles that became stuck underneath the sticker portion of the pad before re-applying it on the actual plastic tub. Time will tell if this will remain stuck.- Accessories: sling pad and clip-on bar + toys are made in China which I have nothing against if the manufacturing is done right and the materials are non-toxic, but the hanging toys are questionable in quality and there is no mention of it's toxicity.OVERALL:My first tub was a blue plastic for my boy. I was excited to see this in person when it was a transparent and sparkly pink tub. Very princess-like and 100% better than that first blue tub I purchased for practically the same price.Too bad the foam pads were loose and the tub plus included accessories are not advertised as BPA free.

The handles are seriously padded (nice and high for me at 5ft.5in., though non-adjusting) and fixed slightly inwards for a more natural feel.I love the solid lever used to raise and lower the seat for both sides/directions. You can also strip the ENTIRE fabric seat/sides from the frame and throw it in the wash!The canopy is huge and sturdy. It easily adjusts without having to be removed in order to switch positions (it was difficult to initially lock the canopy into place-best way is from the FRONT for leverage).The wheels are smooth, lightweight hard rubber, but the ride is generally quiet with little vibration. I can easily maneuver around tight corners with only one hand (having front wheels UNlocked). With front wheels locked, I am able to run fast on a straightaway without any wobbles. Also, back wheel brakes lock at the same time instead of independently (limits accidental rolling).The Baby Jogger Vue is extremely easy to set up once you flip open the the side lock (it automatically locks when you fold the stroller down) and step on the back middle lever. Folding down the stroller is just as easy if you ALWAYS do this: 1.Step on the small side lever once. 2. Step on the big middle lever. 3.

You unfold the stroller, pop on the wheels, easy peasy. The canopy, took me a while. I couldn't in the manual. It's there, page 13. But I figured it out on my own. You might want to play with the stroller for a bit. Of course, with a curious toddler... that's another thing!Now I gotta say, I live on a farm. I was worried I wouldn't be able to use it at home. Think gravel driveway, uneven ground, sandy ditch. I never bothered with my little pink, doll looking umbrella stroller.

The instructions are fairly easy to follow - I had to ask my husband for help with snapping the canopy into place, for some reason one side just didn't want to go in and he had to use quite a bit of muscle to get it snapped it.  I really love the reversible seat allowing baby to be forward-facing or outward facing- up until the baby is old enough to sit up well on their own I absolutely prefer the baby to be facing me.  I've also found this feature very nice when we're out for walks on windy days and the wind was blowing head-on, it took just a few moments to take the baby out and flip the seat (one-handed!), and have baby facing towards me so there was no worry about the baby being exposed to wind.  The canopy is nice and large and provides really good coverage from both sides.I also really like that the seat fully reclines both ways - perfect for when baby falls asleep, and the foot rest is adjustable as well to help keep baby even more comfortable and asleep longer.  The stroller folds very easily and has a snap-lock, then you just grab the handle and you're good to go - it's very easy to transport and not too heavy.  The swiveling wheels can be locked so that they only go forwards and backwards which is a nice feature to have depending on the terrain, and the ride is very smooth.A few things I didn't care for: Aside from a small padded head-cradle and shoulder pads for infants on the parent-facing side, there is not much padding to this thing.  I can imagine that for a long ride it might get uncomfortable, especially if the terrain is bumpy.  I also wish there was a peek-a-boo window for when baby is in the forward-facing position - that was one feature I really loved and used on our old stroller.Overall I really like the stroller and feel it's well made, but I feel it's a bit over-priced for what it offers.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Baby Jogger Vue Stroller", "unixReviewTime": 1401408000, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2014"},

However, in most foreign countries, most bathroom floors have drains, so larger round basin/bathtubs work just as well.

The Levana Sophia is a good basic video monitor with the core features that you will likely need.  There are better quality monitors with more features out there, but they come at a higher price point.  This will definitely meet your needs if you are just looking for a basic monitor.The Good:* The battery life on this monitor is great and lasts much longer than our other Samsung monitor with a larger screen (Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch).* The picture and sound are clear enough to see and hear the most important things.* We have found this to have a very good signal, it rarely has interruptions.* It includes two-way communication, which not all basic monitors include, and which can be very useful. In our case, we only found this feature useful when our kids were toddlers - when they were babies talking to them this way was not helpful or calming.* It is expandable to up to four cameras and will scan through them so you can monitor multiple kids at the same time.The Bad:* This camera does not allow you to adjust the camera position (pan & tilt) from the monitor.  Whether or not you really need this feature likely depends on where you have your camera located.  We have had times where something partially blocked the camera view and being able to adjust it prevented us from having to go into a sleeping child's room.  If you have the camera mounted on a wall with a very open view of the crib, this will probably not be a problem for you.* The screen is relatively small.  For the most part, this is okay since you really usually want to know if your child is awake or asleep, but there are times where it becomes hard to see what is going on.Overall, I think this monitor is a great choice for caregivers looking for a video monitor with basic features.

It has good color resolution, night vision capability, and is fully portable -with a rechargeable backup battery.  It also has audio, and allows you to push a button and talk back to the camera.  (Additionally, it also has an antenna that can be flipped up to give you more range -helpful if you are outside.)  Finally, it allows you to turn the brightness up or down which is what you'd need to do if you wanted to use this outside.PROS:+++ CAMERA HAS COLOR PICTURE.  Don't they all, these days? But, in any case, it is color and looks nice.  Picture quality is excellent+++ HAS NIGHT VISION.  Once the room gets dark enough the color disappears and the picture becomes black and white, but allows you to see in the dark.  This function works very well.  And once the light is turned on it switches right back to color.+++ GOOD AUDIO.  You can hear pretty well from the camera's microphone and there is a neat LED across the top display which lights up more LEDs the more the camera picks up noise.  So, there would be a visual indicator of red LEDS if the baby was crying.  (This is helpful because if you muted it you'd still know the baby was crying by the LED indicators.)+++ RECHARGEABLE BATTERY.  This is pretty awesome.  You can unplug the monitor station and take it with you around the house.  It will typically last all day, but require recharging near the end of the day if baby has had multiple long naps.  (However, you can also use it plugged in as well.  You do not need the battery.  In fact, we use both.  We keep it by the bed at night, plugged in, and then move it downstairs in the morning or during afternoon naps, and only use the battery at this time.)++ TALKBACK FUNCTION.  You can press a button and talk back to the camera -it acts just like an intercom.  This might be useful if you were using it in the house with young children.++ EASY VOLUME UP OR DOWN.  Right below the screen there is a very simple to use volume toggle.++ LOUD CHIRPING WHEN BATTERY RUNS LOW.  When the (rechargeable) battery is going to run out (usually at the end of a day of usage, after at least a few hours of baby naps) it produces a loud beep every minute.  At first I hated this but then I realized how important and helpful it was.  It was basically telling me, &#34;hey, I am going to turn off in 5 minutes, and you need to charge me&#34;.  God forbid it just turned off and you went happily about your business in another room (or were sleeping) not realizing the monitor was no longer working, and then something happened to your child.  This was a great feature, and it reinforces my high opinion of this product.++ CAN HOOK UP MULTIPLE CAMERAS.  I didn't use this function but I found the menu on the device.  It clearly can hook up to three other cameras, and you can view them at the same time (I believe) while then selecting the main camera to watch.  I did not test this function so please do your own research on this capability.++ MONITOR FLIP OUT STAND.  This means you can place the monitor almost vertical, which provides an easy viewing angle.++ HAS A TEMPERATURE GAUGE.  This is a neat feature, and I liked it.  It shows you the temperature of the room with the camera right on the monitor.+ TALK BACK FUNCTION WORKS WELL.  This is an improvement over the other Levana monitor, where the talkback function sounds metallic.  This does not, and sounds pretty good.CONS:-- VISIBLE LIGHTS.  Unlike the other Levana camera set (Levana Lila Digital Baby Video Monitor with Night Vision and Talk to Baby Intercom 32000 (White) ) which has no NO VISIBLE LIGHTS, this one has an unfortunate red power LED on the front, and a dual LED yellow one on the top.  Unfortunately this provides a focal point for your baby.  Not a big deal for a very young one, but I guarantee if your child can stand he or she will immediately swat this from the crib unless it is anchored on the wall.-- DOES NOT SWIVEL.  Also unlike the other Levana camera set (Levana Lila Digital Baby Video Monitor with Night Vision and Talk to Baby Intercom 32000 (White) ) this monitor does not swivel on the X axis (horizontally), only the Y axis (vertically).  This means that if you mount it against the wall (hardware not included) you will need to place it exactly above your crib in order to get the proper view.  No placing it on a side wall or at an angle like with the other monitor noted above.  If you have a well situated tall table, however, this may not be a big deal for you.-- NO BELT CLIP.  This kind of cripples the use of this as something you'd wear while working outside.  But, on the other hand, presumably you'd want to SEE it, and wouldn't want to carry it around on your belt.  That said, it would have been nice, at least to help in monitoring a baby sleeping.  It does have a stand.  It looks like a belt clip but it is not, and it will come apart with very little pressure.  It is only useful to stand up the monitor.Overall, I am happy with this product, but I would pick the other Levana monitor over this one because it swivels more, and doesn't have lights on the front.  The temperature gauge wasn't important enough to me to sway the deal.  Either way, however, I highly recommend this brand, and I recommend both this (and the other monitor) in particular.  I have used the almost identical one for over a year and it continues to hold up well.

It has very good range as well, although as you get further away, you'll see &#34;lines&#34; through the picture.  It's almost like interference but it's not snow.  The refresh rate is kind of slow, but among entry level models, that's normal.  Monitors that advertise higher resolutions really don't have much better resolution than this one, since they almost all broadcast a  standard TV signal or half-resolution signal, regardless of the resolution of the camera itself.  The camera and picture are similar to most others in that colors are washed out, the refresh rate is low, and it has a hard time compensating for backlit subjects.  If you're using this to monitor a crib, most of these things aren't a problem.What this monitor lacks compared to higher end ones is the pan/tilt/zoom type of feature.  Sometimes that's useful if you have a room where the camera isn't a wide enough angle to see everything in one position.  The other thing is that even though this camera can be tilted up or down, it can't be rotated on its base.  Therefore, if you plan to wall mount, it needs to be in a direct line with whatever you're monitoring.Levana has a nice system where the video screen can shut off while the audio is still present.  Then, if a noise exceeding a certain volume level is heard, the screen will automatically wake up.  So, if you need to use it on battery power for a while, it's not going to drain too quickly.Overall, this is a good entry level monitor that functions well and if you only need the basics.

They have ranged from the very high end units that have huge screens, wifi capability, pan/zoom, lullabies, and all of the other bells an whistles. For us, we have found that a relatively basic camera - with a decen sized screen (and the Levana Sophia's 2.4&#34; screen falls into that category) is the best for us.Notes-- The base unit and the camera pair very easily (automatically) with each other. We have used some brands that require a manual pairing, but not here- Expandable up to 4 cameras- Very easy to talk 2-way from the base unit/monitor. This may not seem like a big idea, but it is handy when the biggest most prominent button is the two way talk button.- The night vision mode is grainy, but it is the equivalent of EVERY baby monitor on the market. Unless you are willing to spend A LOT more you will need to accept a grainy night vision shot. Honestly, we have gotten used to the view quality.- The screen is big enough.... some (higher priced) baby monitors have larger screens, but we have found that this is not always what it is cracked up to be. Larger screen add to the weight (not that big of a deal), size (a bigger footprint on your night stand), typically decrease video quality (because the cameras are rarely improved enough to offer a picture for the increased resolution), and it decreases battery life.- The Levana Sophia monitor is completely rechargeable- It does come with a built in room thermometer (which can be set to both Fahrenheit and Celsius) - we just wish the displayed temperature was a larger and easier to read.- We have not had any problem with the camera interfering with our internet, cell phones, or cordless phones..- One feature that it does not have - that we kinda like having (again it does come at a cost) is a pan feature. We may use the pan feature on the camera 2 or 3 times a year, and it roughly doubles the price point of the baby monitor.Final Verdict - If you are in the market for a video baby monitor the Levana Sophia is definitely worth considering . There are baby monitors with more features (larger screens, lullabies, video outputs, Wifi) but we have found that most of those features are very rarely used.

Because my grandson is active and, a bit of a ham, a video monitor is desirable.  I found the &#8220;Levana Sophia 2.4&#8221; Digital Video Baby Monitor&#8221; is both an excellent video monitor and reasonably priced.  The unit is compact and the parent monitor charges quickly &#8211; the one I received charged within two hours!The voice transmission is excellent &#8211; sounds are crisp and clear.  Sound is adjustable.  If your little one is an active sleeper, this feature is especially nice.  At its least sensitive setting, the monitor does not transmit the light moans and grunts, but does transmit sounds that might indicate a problem.  The two-way communication feature is something that is useful when you are dealing with a toddler or preschooler who employs stalling tactics such as &#8220;I&#8217;m thirsty, I need a drink&#8221; or &#8220;I have to go potty&#8221; &#8230;  Many times, the simple sound of a parent/grandparent&#8217;s voice will be sufficient to obviate the &#8220;need&#8221;.  In a one story home, the sound transmission worked well through multiple walls and closed doors.Video transmission is amazing!  When there is a light in the room, the transmission is in color; the image is better than picture quality of the older analog televisions.  In a darkened room, the picture on the parent monitor is different shades of gray and white &#8211; it is similar to night vision pictures shown on television newscasts.  The pictures, in both light and dark, are clear and easy to see.  If your toddler or preschooler is an imaginative child or one who sings and tells stories to his/her toys, the &#8220;Levana Sophia 2.4&#8221; Digital Video Baby Monitor&#8221; is a fine form of entertainment &#8211; particularly for grandparents.The temperature feature is nice, but not particularly necessary.  Digits display in the lower right corner of the parent monitor, but are less than 1/8&#8221; high.  The nightlight can be turned off which is nice if your child is someone who will not sleep if there is a light in their room.If sightlines are not clear, the &#8220;Levana Sophia 2.4&#8221; Digital Video Baby Monitor&#8221; would be a nice addition to your playroom or family room.  The monitor would allow you to maintain visual contact with your little ones while you are engaged in other tasks.  Further, if you need to speak with the child or children, the two-way communication feature allows you to do so.For all the positive features of the &#8220;Levana Sophia 2.4&#8221; Digital Video Baby Monitor&#8221;, there are several cons.  The stand or belt clip that attaches to the parent unit must be removed to insert the battery.  It is a hard, brittle plastic and removing it requires considerable care so that it does not break.  The information included with the &#8220;Levana Sophia 2.4&#8221; Digital Video Baby Monitor&#8221; is minimal.  You can find the actual product manual at www.mylevana.com &#8211; it is excellent.  You are not required to register your monitor to activate the warranty.  However, should you choose to do so, they ask for the serial number of your unit &#8211; that is located in the battery compartment.  Also, be sure to retain your receipt as the warranty will not be honored without it.Based on its features, its value and its functionality, I am giving the &#8220;Levana Sophia 2.4&#8221; Digital Video Baby Monitor&#8221; 5-stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Five-Stars From This Grandma ...", "unixReviewTime": 1400976000, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2014"},

I will update this review if it ever does due to the nature of Sophia's wireless transmission protocol. Aside from the main feature itself, this is the next most important feature since everyone uses WiFi Internet these days.Night vision is great. It's very clear. i was most impressed with this feature.Easy to setup: I didn't have to configure anything and it just worked.Since this is not a WiFi based product, you won't have to worry about some teenager breaking into your network, harassing your family, and invading your privacy. Yes, it has happened before. For details on the subject, just google news for \"baby monitor hacker\".  To be safe, just don't get a WiFi baby monitor.[Ok]The price is very reasonable.There's some slight lag, but it's not horrible.The overall picture quality is alright, but not awesome. There are a few reviews saying that the quality is HD. It is NOT HD.Sound quality is ok. It's comparable to other baby monitors, but nothing to brag about.[Bad]UPDATE: The remote parent unit does not turn off if you press the off switch once; only the video monitor turns off. To really turn it off, you have to hold down the power button for about five seconds. This has to be one of most dumb design decisions just to save money on an extra button; this isn't an iPad. If you're not aware of this design flaw, the battery will eventually die. What happens when its battery is about to die? It keeps beeping loudly every 30 seconds, draining the battery even faster and waking everyone up. I use to have a natural gas alarm that did the same thing, so I threw it in the garbage. Thankfully you can either just keep this baby monitor parent unit plugged in or hold down the power button for about five seconds to fully turn it off to avoid the annoying beeping. I'm not impressed with Peep Mode.The parent unit does not have the advertised 48 hour battery life, even when it's in \"Peep\" mode for 99% of the time. It is closer to 16-20 hours. This is just really misleading advertising. If they stated that battery life was 24 hours instead of 48 hours, no one would really be complaining. Maybe I have a defective battery? Again, I'm not impressed with Peep Mode.\"Peep Mode\" should be automatic. You shouldn't have to activate / deactivate it with a button that resembles a on/off button. This confuses people. If \"Peep Mode\" really needs a physical button, then it should be a completely separate button from a on/off button; or it should just be removed.It's not a megapixel camera. This is understandable given the low price. However it would be nice to see a product that offered megapixel resolution: 720P and up. Right now only cheap IP cameras provide it. When I think about it, I'm not sure if it's even possible for a wireless camera to be megapixel resolution that isn't using WiFi.It doesn't have a high definition display. This is understandable given the low price and that it doesn't have a megapixel camera.[Misc]I did not have any issues getting the back cover to snap in place again with the battery in place. Could it have been easier to perform? Yes. Is it difficult or hard? No.[Verdict]The parent unit needs a real on / off button. Removing the battery from the unit is not a good substitute.

Temperature was only about 1 or 2 degrees off from the temperature gage we keep in the kids room, so I'd say it's fairly accurate.Why I'm giving this camera 4 stars is because there is no pan feature.

The resolution and framerate (~25 fps) is excellent for practical usage, but isn't as good as, say, a video camera; it looks like a strong sharpening algorithm has been applied to the image, which helps with visibility on the small screen. The same goes for the sound quality (which is at least as good as a cell phone). The camera has infrared technology, so the video is just as good in both dark and light conditions, and the signal range is also pretty good - up to about 90 feet (although the framerate drops to around 10 fps at that distance).I also like the back-and-forth talking capability - the parent can press a button, and speak to the baby through the handset. I have to wonder what the baby thinks of that, though... \"Daddy shrunk and is sitting on the table!\" The camera even looks like a dude wearing a headset; you can't tell from the pictures, but there's a little microphone extending to the place where the mouth would be.The camera itself needs to be plugged in, but the handset is chargeable, so you can unplug it and carry it around with you. The power supplies for both the camera and the handset are the same and are interchangeable (they have the same input/output and connectors). They don't look exactly the same, though; the wall plugs look different, and one of them has a picture of a handset on it. I can only assume that it was meant to be used for the handset, although it also works for the camera.  It would have been nice if a micro-USB charger worked with either, especially the for recharging the handset.The instructions are mostly in pictures and don't use very much text to explain usage, and the handset interface is designed without any text, so the monitor is great for people who don't understand English. It can be a little confusing at times (I had some trouble figuring out how the settings worked), but basic usage is very quick and simple.The camera part of the monitor can be rotated to point upwards or downwards, but it's a bit limited; it cannot point very far up or down. It can be mounted on the wall, but due to the small range of movement, it will probably end up pointing towards the floor. Tabletop usage is fine, however.Being able to see the temperature in baby's room is a very nice touch, and will be particularly reassuring during very cold or hot weather.  Obviously this would also be very useful in monitoring pets in the garage or in an enclosed patio etc.I would recommend this monitor to a parent who wants an easy, safe way to keep an eye on his or her baby.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works very well, looks great", "unixReviewTime": 1403740800, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2014"},

The set up was quite easy, and the video quality was very good, especially for the price point this is offered at.  Since I have used sound monitors exclusively (the exception being the iBaby fiasco) I wasn't sure what to expect from a video monitor.  I was very impressed with the quality.  Obviously it isn't HD quality, and the &#34;daytime&#34; color picture is better than the B/W &#34;night vision&#34;, but the B/W picture is still a good quality image.  In my opinion, the sound quality of this monitor isn't on par with my Sony monitor, but I didn't find it to be hard to hear, &#34;tinney&#34;, or warbly, as some of the others reviewers stated.

It can be positioned in a wide range of angles although you have to do it manually. The photocell is located right in front of the cam and the microphone on the bottom right. It has a power button at the back of the base.Power adapters:Both power adapters are exactly the same specs so there is no worry of overloading if you mixed them up. There is a picture at the back of each adapter though to indicate which is for the cam and which is for the receiver. The cord for the camera is much longer than the receiver's which is nice so you have more flexibility in placement. 120 volts only at 250mAh.Night Vision:Switches to night vision automatically when it senses there is not enough light in the room.Summary:I have tried many baby monitors, some are from more popular brands and I am impressed with the video quality and the audio on both the baby and parent unit. Most of them sounds terrific when you listen to your baby on your parent unit, but the usual problem is that when you use the mic and talk from the parent unit, it is almost unintelligible when it comes out of the baby unit. This monitor did a good job that the baby hear the parent instead of an electronic garble.

To help prevent SIDS, blankets are not allowed in our son's crib.  I have used a number of different swaddler blankets and sleep sacks with my son. He outgrows them and a larger size needs to be purchased. This gets expensive. As a sleep sack, this is nice because it will last a long time. It is about 33&#34; long from the top (shoulder area) to the bottom. It is very large. The recommended age being 6-18 months for this particular grobag. If you have a small six month old, they may get swallowed up in this bag.To use as a travel sack, there is an opening in the back that is velcroed shut. The front has a double zipper (one coming down from the top & one coming up fron the bottom). Use the double zipper so that they are both zipped down/up near the back velcro area, but open. You stick the buckle part of the harness through the back opening and out the front zipper. The shoulder straps for the car seat or stroller go over top the grobag and then are inserted into the bottom buckle that you pulled through the back. Depending once again on the size of your child and if your car seat is forward or backward facing, when used in your car seat there may be an exessive amount of material from the grobag. It functions better for smaller kids in the stroller since the material has more room to hang over the bottom.The print is colorful and fun. The outer layer is woven cotton, which is soft but not snuggly. The inside has a super soft jersey lining. Which is very nice and soft. In between to keep your child warm is a quick dry polyester filling. It is a thick material and between all the layers, you might only be able to use this on a cool day.  We live in the East coast and get very hot summers so we would not use this during that time.  This comes with a cardboard thermometer to tell you the temperature of your room. On the back is a chart showing temperature ranges and the appropriate layers of clothes to use under the grobag.Overall, this is a really nice product. I like the versatility and the fact I can use it as our son grows. One of our son's other sleep sacks has what I would describe as a fabric belt that Velcros over his chest.

(TOG is a British unit for measuring blankets.  I read the Wikipedia entry, and I don't understand TOG, but higher number TOG means it is warmer.)Here is the info from Gro Company's chart:0.5 TOG = use for 75 F to 81 F1.0 TOG = use for 69 F to 74 F2.5 TOG = use for 61 F to 68 F3.5 TOG = use for 54 F to 59 FThe thermometer doesn't just tell you what temperature it is, but also tells you how to dress your baby for the temperature.  This is completely stress free idiot-proof baby dressing.  If you got one each in all 4 weights, you would be out way too much cash, but you also could dress the baby (or have someone else dress the baby) without having to think or worry about under or over dressing.  This idiot-proof system is great.For this particular sleep sack, if I could do it again, I would get a lighter weight.  This 2.5 TOG sleep sack is worn in nursery temperatures that are lower than 68 degrees Fahrenheit.  I didn't realize this when I ordered.  TOG is British.  I'm from Florida.  Now, I live in Texas.  I tend to live in warm climates and I may go without AC, but I can't go without heat if it is that cold out. For me, and perhaps for you, a 0.5 TOG or a 1.0 TOG sleep sack would be more practical.Moving on to the sleepsack design.  I have previously used Guna Pod and Halo sleep sacks.  Halo comes in two weights:  cotton and fleece.  Some brands (Aden and Anais?) come in a very light weight gauzy cotton.  The Gro Company sack comes in 4 weights, so covers a broader range.  The included thermometer ensures you will pick the correct sack.  The 2.5 TOG one is very cute and nicely constructed.  It is like wearing a cotton quilt with polyester fill.  It is hard to describe holding the sack, but the sides of it really are like a quilt - it has a few layers of material to make the fabric.  I think it is warmer than the Halo fleece sleep sacks.  The layers that show and touch baby are cotton and feel good to the touch.This particular sleep sack is advertised as something you can use with a carseat or with stroller straps.  It has velcro slits in the back, for using with straps.  This was hard to do, but I guess it's an option.  From looking at other Gro Company products, they have a standard style sleep sack that is meant just for crib use.  That other style has snaps on the shoulder, which this sack does not.  I think that that other style is more practical, because having options for ways to get baby's arms in and out of the sack becomes useful when they get squirmy or drowsy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Mistake proof sleep sack system", "unixReviewTime": 1396396800, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2014"},

Also, the batting is 100% polyester, which in my opinion is not a breathable or comfortable substance to sleep between.

{"reviewerID": "A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT", "asin": "B00I2IAJCG", "reviewerName": "Silvester Percival", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "The Gro-Egg thermometer is a neat idea that works exactly as it's advertised.  It glows in four different colors to indicate the temperature range in the room: blue (under 61F -- too cold); yellow (61-67F -- recommended); orange (68-75F -- a little warm); and red (over 75F -- too hot).  Here are the positives that may persuade you to purchase:* The digital thermometer seems to be very accurate.  Its readouts consistently align with an expensive scientific thermometer I have in the house.  It's also very close to my home thermostat, which makes it easy to adjust room temperature using the Gro-Egg.* You really get a night-light and thermometer all rolled into one.  The soft glow produced by the Gro-Egg is the perfect amount -- not too bright, not too dim.  The unique colors are an added bonus.  The product is worth at least $5 or $10 just for the night-light.* The unit is lightweight and seems to be well constructed.  It is powered by an AC cord (included) and has a subtle on/off switch on the bottom.*  I think it looks good, both as a nightlight and as a thermometer.  We sit in on the top of the crib.Now for the part in which I explain why the Gro-Egg is not for everyone.  I am seriously skeptical of the temperature range the company recommends.  They say the ideal temperature is 61-67.  Are they from Siberia?  That's downright cold even for my adult skin, even when I'm wearing a sweater, and even when I'm covered in multiple blankets.  How they think that's appropriate for a baby (which, as all responsible parents know, should NOT be left in a crib full of blankets to suffocate in) is a little bit baffling.  Now, I'm sure there's some doctor out there who claims this is the ideal temperature range, but there are probably just as many who claim something else.  I find my own baby wakes up frequently and is fussy if it's this cold in the house.  Low to mid 70s seems far more ideal.And then there is the practicality of the company's recommended temperatures.  I live in central Texas and it's blazing hot for 6 months out of the year.  Like most Texans who strive to keep their electric bills reasonable, I keep the thermostat at 79-80 during the day and 77 at night.  Never lower.  Someone reading this is the northern climes might think I'm nuts and this is torturous for the baby, but even at these relatively high settings the AC runs for a good part of the day and makes the house feel nice, especially relative to the outside temperature.  Just like northerners adapt to the cold, our bodies adapt to the heat.  It feels comfortable after a while.  Moreover, even if I set my thermostat at 65 or 67 to reach the ideal temperature recommended by the Glo-Egg, the AC unit would run night and day and never get the house that cold.  It's just impossible (unless you have triple-paned windows and three times the recommended volume of insulation).  It would also cost a fortune.What all the above means is that I -- and many others who live in warm climates -- will not be able to take advantage of the color-coded temperature indicator.  I wish they would add a little switch allowing the user to toggle different ranges for each season (or according to their tastes).  For example, the switch could have a setting for &#34;Winter,&#34; &#34;Summer,&#34; and &#34;Temperate&#34; (i.e. spring/fall) seasons.  The Winter setting could use the present recommended range of 61-67.  The Temperate Season setting could make the ideal setting shift to 68-75, and the other color ranges would shift accordingly.  Finally, the Summer setting could make the ideal between 75 and 80, or something like that.  Obviously each individual user could decide according to their own preferences which setting best suited their and their baby's needs, but an adjustment switch like this would help everyone take advantage of the product's features.  As it is, my baby will be sleeping under a red nightlight until late September!The price seems a bit high at nearly $40, but, as I said before, you are really getting two products in one along with some other features that might suit your needs just right.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works as advertised, but not for everyone", "unixReviewTime": 1405296000, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2014"},

I can compare this one to the Motorola MBP36 and I like this one better because the video quality is so much better on this one. I thought the MBP36 was good until I got this one, then it was absolutely no contest. In fact, I wish I could return the MBP36. The MBP36 is good because you can pan the camera remotely using the controls on the monitor and I like that the buttons on the monitor is on the face and not on the edges because that makes it so you are not constantly accidentally pushing buttons when you're carrying it, but that's it. In video quality, this one wins hands down and since that's the most important part - I prefer this one. The camera is static (doesn't pan).  This is a great camera that shows you enough detail on your baby - enough to where you can see them breathing - day or night.  If you want a camera that shows you more area, like the entire room, you may want to look into the wide angle version.What could be improved:1. Battery life of the monitor - it only lasts a few hours of continuous use. The charger does have an extra long cable, but it would be nice if the battery life was better.2. The buttons are all along the edges of the monitor - this is nice because you get a very nice big viewing screen, but not so nice because you're constantly accidentally hitting buttons on the thing when you're carring it around.3. Picture quality - Yes, it's much better video quality than the Motorola MBP36 and it's good enough that you can easily see your baby breathing, but it could always be better....if we're being greedy.What is great:1. Screen size is bigger and better than the MBP362. Great video quality - you can easily watch your baby breathing3. Great night vision - you can easily watch baby breathing4. Very reliable5. Excellent portability - I have a 1500 sq ft house on a half acre lot and I'm able to monitor the baby from pretty much my entire property. So everywhere in the house and out in the yard as well. Excellent. It beats the Motorola MBP36 in this area as well.6. Has an internal antenna which is way nicer than the externa antenna of the Motorola MBP36 - while still having better connection.7. The stand is better and sturdier on the monitor than the MBP368. Pretty much everything you need to monitor your baby.9. The monitor and camera can be closer together before you get feedback - basically, just as long as they are at least 2 feet apart, you won't have feedback issues. Not like the MBP36 which gets feedback if they are in the same room. This is especially important if you're trying to adjust the placement of the camera while looking at the monitor. Or - if you rig this up in your car to use as a car baby monitor (which I did). I would recommend using the non-wide screen version if using in the car, but this one would work as well. I love using this in the car because 1. It's way better than trying to rig up a bunch of mirrors to monitor my baby in her rear facing car seat. 2. You can't see the baby with mirrors if driving at night - but you can with this monitor because of the night vision. 3. With the zoom feature, you can easily see baby breathing in her car seat - this is especially important with the rise in incidents where babies stop breathing in their car seats. I am able to drive with confidence and not have to worry because I can totally see her face and chest and know everything is okay. I have the monitor mounted on my dash with a GPS monitor that accepts a 5&#34; screen.10.

When primarily breastfeeding (we wanted a bottle to feed expressed milk occasionally so mom can get some sleep!) you want a nipple that is still going to require a bit of effort on your baby's part to suck the milk out. This one will drip when tipped upside down without any effort at all. If not for the flow issue these would definitely get 5 stars from me. I'll probably give them another try when we're at the stage of requiring more flow but in the meantime they'll be waiting in the cabinet.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent bottles but flow is a bit fast", "unixReviewTime": 1400025600, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2014"},

It stays on when it should and pops off with some effort. Covering the entire top, instead of just the nipple, makes it harder to accidentally loosen the top. A loose top can make a big mess inside a baby go-bag.(2) The nipple is very supple. It's soft and flexible. It moves with the baby and maintains a good seal. This is more comfortable to the baby and let's less air in around the lips. This means less burping. Also important, it's soft, but not sticky.(3) The anti-colic valve is the stand-out feature. One potential cause of colic is indigestion/gas/reflux from bottle feeding. A good seal helps, but sometimes the baby can continue sucking the empty bottle, creating a vacuum that can lead to acid reflux, e.g., the baby's stomach acid is pulled up through the esophagus. This can lead to heartburn and spitting up. The blue duckbill valve in this bottle will open when a vacuum is created. The baby may get gassy from ingesting air, but will not reflux.#1 and #2 are solid advantages in my book. #3 is more theoretical than practical, but if your baby is colicky or spits up a lot, you should seriously consider this bottle.Looking forward to buying more upon release.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Costs more than some competitors, but worth it.", "unixReviewTime": 1395878400, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2014"},

Here's our criteria for a baby bottle and where the Munchkin fails to win us over:Our Baby Bottle Criteria:====================First and foremost,BABY MUST LIKE IT!---------------------------------Munchkin Latch Bottle:Fails here because the nipple easily collapses.  Just a very slight pressure with your finger and the nipple collapses.  Now, imagine a moving baby with a slurping motion and this nipple collapses too easily.Avent Classic Bottle:We have a dozen of these from our firstborn.  Unfortunately, our son just won't take these.  We tried all of the nipple sizes from NB to level 3, he just won't take it.  We had learned long ago to just get 1 bottle of each type, because different babies like different bottles, no rhyme or reason.  Our daughter loved these.Avent Natural Flow bottle/nipple:He will actually finish a full bottle with this, but the bib and burp cloth will be drenched.  The wider/flat design means he just drools and drools.  Maybe good for others, but not for him.Dr. Brown:He was colic-y at first and this is the only bottle he would take without drooling.  He loves them, we the parents despise them because of the cleaning - 6 parts to clean.  But baby first and we endured this for 6-7 months until we discovered the Lansinoh mOmma *Natural Wave* bottles.Lansinoh mOmma *Natural Wave* bottle:I put asterisks around Natural Wave because Lansinoh has an older &#34;Lansinoh mOmma&#34; that is round in shape (and has orange coloring).  The Lansinoh mOmma natural wave bottles look like regular bottles and are purple in coloring.  So make sure you are reading about the right mOmma type!This is the only bottle in addition to the Dr. Brown that he would take.  No drooling (we don't even need a bib or burp cloth), he finishes everything and most of all, it is so easy to clean!  (just 4 parts more on that later)After baby approves, the next criteria is:HOW EASY IS IT TO CLEAN?==========================Munchkin Latch Bottle:This is pretty terrible, probably 1-star for cleaning along with Dr. Brown.  The nipple is an accordion design on the bottom that is supposed to allow for easy movement (and probably why it collapses so easy under suction).  Well, can you imagine trying to clean in between the grooves of an accordion?  What a pain.  Then, it has this blue-vent piece at the bottom of the bottle that you have to pop out and has small crevices that you can't really fit any bottle brush into, not even the Munchkin baby bottle brush set - hah!  Furthermore, having this &#34;hole&#34; at the bottom is terrible if you soak your bottles with water because you always have to have the blue-vent piece in there.Avent Classic:Probably a 2 for cleaning because it has 5 parts.  It has this blue ring that is annoying to clean.  We put up with it for 2 years until we switch our daughter to cow milk.Avent Natural Flow:Probably a 4 for cleaning because it has 4 parts.  The middle nipple-holder piece is designed just-so that it really tears up the sponges in your bottle brush.Dr. Brown:All parents despise cleaning them, yet baby-first and this is the bottle we used for 6-7 months until we discovered the new Lansinoh mOmma redesign.  If I could give negative stars for cleaning a Dr. Brown bottle I would.  All of the small intricate parts are a pain to clean, ask anyone, bleh.Lansinoh mOmma *Natural Wave* purple bottle:We love it, 5-stars for cleaning.  4 simple parts that is compatible with our bottle brush, nice wide design, easy to assemble, super easy to clean.OVERALL DESIGN THOUGHTS:===========================Munchkin Latch Bottle:Terrible.  The lid completely covers the middle-nipple-holder part.  This means after you have warmed up the bottle with hot water, you spin and spin the lid because there's no other surface to grab and it's slippery because it is wet.  If you have soapy hands and are trying to unscrew the top, it will spin and spin, too. All of the other bottles, the lid rests-on or at least is designed such that you can easily grip and separate the cap/lid.  Terrible to transport, must use a sealing disc, else it leaks.Avent Classic:Has a flat top.  Easy to put down the cap/lid and won't roll away while adding formula, etc.  Easy to grip, just don't like the extra &#34;ring&#34; that must be cleaned.  Used this for 2 years with our first one.  Smallest size is 4 ounces or 125 ML - this was too little and the 9 ounce was a big leap.  5 ounces would have been perfect for a long time. Easy to transport, no spills, nothing extra required.Avent Natural Flow:Same slippery lid issue as the Munchkin, but not as bad.  Rolls around the counter if you take the cap/lid off.  Smallest size is also 4 ounces/125 ml.  Easy to transport, no spills, nothing extra required.Dr. Brown:The bottle we the parents despised cleaning the most, but we used it for 6-7 months because it DID help with a colic-y baby.  Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.  Smallest size is 4 ounces /120 ml, but you CANNOT overfill, it will leak. We despise the 9-ounce version of Dr. Brown - too big for our bottle brush and bleh it actually makes cleaning worse if that was possible.  Another terrible design is that you have to take the cap off to install a sealing-disc if you transport this!  The last thing you want to do in a public place is have to take the cap off, etc exposing the milk to the elements.  If you put this in an insulated cooler and the bottle is not kept vertical and tips over, you'll have milk everywhere.Lansinoh mOmma Natural Wave (the purple one, not the orange one):The lid is great, it has a completely flat side that is easy to put down and won't roll around.  Our baby can drink an entire bottle with no bib or burp cloth.  The smallest size is 5 ounces which is perfect for our baby's needs. Easy to transport, no spills, nothing extra required.Given the reasons/criteria above, the Munchkin Latch is a 2 star bottle for us.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Nipple easily collapses, frustrates baby!", "unixReviewTime": 1400630400, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2014"},

However, those were well worn and it was time for a new set, so we decided to try Munchkin's bottles and these seemed similar to the Playtex.Overall, we found this to be a good bottle.  These come in three sizes (4, 6 and 8 ounces) and the 8 ounce is a good size for once baby gets to be a few months old.  The shape is easy to hold and each bottle in the set comes with it's own lid, nipple and flat rubber cover which can be used for transporting the bottles.  In addition, each set is BPA free.  I was initially concerned that the anti-colic valve in the bottom might leak, but it did not and it was also easy to pop in and out.  In addition, unlike the Playtex brand, it is very easy to see if it is in place or not, eliminating potential late night spills because you don't realize there's a piece missing.  However, the + 2 nipple is very fast flow, at least as compared to other brands we've tried (Nuk, Playtex, The First Years) , and will release milk without sucking required.  Given that this is a good size for a baby that can hold their own bottle, this has the potential for a fairly big mess.  One of the benefits of the Playtex was that it was a good balance between slow flow and overly hard to get the milk out (we tried The First Years Breastflow and found those both very hard for our newborn to use and the cause of much lost breast milk).  Overall, it is a good bottle, but be prepared for fast flow with the nipples that come with it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good bottle - fast flow nipple", "unixReviewTime": 1395964800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2014"},

The bottles are fitted with what Munchkin calls &#8220;stage 1&#8221; nipples, which means slow flow (0-3 months). For the review purpose they also provided us with four &#8220;stage 2&#8221; nipples (medium flow, 3-6 months), which you need to buy SEPERATELY.The design of these bottles are excellent. First, they are BPA-free, which is standard these days for bottles but still a plus. Second, they feature a valve at the bottom to allow air to go in through the bottom to refill the void left after each suckle. This is very nice in theory and Munchkin claims it can help reduce colic. In practice, this is hard to know for sure: we do not really observe any significant difference in this aspect when compared to Avent... In fact, if these bottles have any cons, it would this valve. With simple bottles, you know you can clean every surface by boiling them in water. The valves on these Munchkin bottles, on the other hand, makes for a lingering worry... (I was told that this is not a problem since the high temperature can still reach the tiny space in the valve.)In our opinion, the nipples are what sets the Munchkins apart from its competitors. First, they are press operated. That means pressing (not biting or sucking) harder will release more milk. In practice this works wonder and the baby seems to really get this idea on the very first trial. I think this is good evidence that the Munchkin design is closer to mother nature. Second, the nipples also stretch considerably, which means the baby really latches on to the nipple and we do not see the same &#8220;suction pulling&#8221; on the inflexible nipples. This, we think, is the primary reason for colic reduction if there is any. Kudos to Munchkins for figuring this out. We, as well as the baby, are in love with these nipples.Based on the nipple design on the Munchkins, we think we will be recommending Munchkins to our friends in the future.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent design (but comes with a tiny sanitization concern?)", "unixReviewTime": 1400112000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2014"},

I have been through many different brands, searching for the perfect fit. Up until my exposure to Munchkin's Latch, my bottle of choice was theThe First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 5 Ounce. In fact, the Breastflow bottles were the only brand we used that did not cause issues when our boy was switching between breast and bottle; so I still recommend it. However, I now prefer the Latch.Unfortunately, I did not discover Munchkin's Latch until the babe was 9 months old, so I cannot say for sure whether it would have also prevented breast to bottle to breast transition issues. Seeing how the boy interacts with the bottle - the nipple in particular - I do believe that the Latch replicates the natural process well. In my opinion, the broader base of the nipple on the Latch does an excellent job simulating the areola, which babies quickly learn to manipulate to increase milk flow. Complementing the broad base is a degree of nipple flexibility that I have seen on very few bottles. The flexible base further facilitates a more natural interaction between baby and bottle at feeding time. The one drawback of this more natural feel is that the tip of the nipple can become slightly inverted from time to time due to the negative air pressure caused by suckling and the wider, flexible surface area. To me, the other attributes of this bottle more than make up for this small issue, which requires that the bottle be removed from the baby's mouth until the nipple self-corrects.Like I said, our son is a little older. It is for this reason that the 8 ounce bottles are the perfect size for his typical feedings. If your child is younger than six months old, you may want to consider getting theMunchkin Latch BPA-Free Bottle, 4 Ounce, 4 Countinstead.

Edwards", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Being a Dad, my experience of feeding time centers around how receptive our little guy is to whichever bottle I choose to use. I have been through many different brands, searching for the perfect fit. Up until my exposure to Munchkin's Latch, my bottle of choice was theThe First Years 1 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 5 Ounce. In fact, the Breastflow bottles were the only brand we used that did not cause issues when our boy was switching between breast and bottle; so I still recommend it. However, I now prefer the Latch.Unfortunately, I did not discover Munchkin's Latch until the babe was 9 months old, so I cannot say for sure whether it would have also prevented breast to bottle to breast transition issues. Seeing how the boy interacts with the bottle - the nipple in particular - I do believe that the Latch replicates the natural process well. In my opinion, the broader base of the nipple on the Latch does an excellent job simulating the areola, which babies quickly learn to manipulate to increase milk flow. Complementing the broad base is a degree of nipple flexibility that I have seen on very few bottles. The flexible base further facilitates a more natural interaction between baby and bottle at feeding time. The one drawback of this more natural feel is that the tip of the nipple can become slightly inverted from time to time due to the negative air pressure caused by suckling and the wider, flexible surface area. To me, the other attributes of this bottle more than make up for this small issue, which requires that the bottle be removed from the baby's mouth until the nipple self-corrects.Like I said, our son is a little older. It is for this reason that the 8 ounce bottles are the perfect size for his typical feedings. If your child is younger than six months old, you may want to consider getting theMunchkin Latch BPA-Free Bottle, 4 Ounce, 2 Countinstead.

Perhaps she will never be an engineer, as I had hoped. Anyway, I think the venting valves on these Latch bottles are great in principle. But the valve seems to require a fair bit of vacuum before it opens to let air in. Combined with the unusually broad shape of the nipple, this frequently causes the nipple to get sucked into an inverted position.In my mind the nipple is more to blame for this than the valve. You don't want the valve leaking liquid, so it needs some pre-tension holding it shut. The resulting vacuum is not enough to significantly interfere with milk flow, so that is acceptable. At least the valve serves some real function. The nipple shape, on the other hand, could easily be changed to a more conical form that would resist collapse, with little if any loss of comfort. Basically I feel the nipple on here is more a marketing thing to appear different from other brands than something that is actually improved in any significant way. And any \"pumping\" is very obviously marketing hype BS, if nipple inversion is CLEARLY indicating the presence of vacuum -- rather than pressure -- inside the bottle.

I filed a warranty request, someone called me the next day and is sending me a replacement!  Great customer service.  Here are the problems with my stroller:1. The lock on one of the front wheels keeps engaging itself in the middle of pushing the stroller.  The button for the wheel lock is up to unlock and down to lock.  The lever must be loose since the button keeps falling down into the lock position.  Bad design in my opinion. The lock should be the other way around. Pull up to lock instead.2. Car seat belt detached from the belt.  The plastic buckle on the belt that is used to secure the car seat keeps falling off the belt.  I keep rethreading the belt but the plastic buckle keeps falling off because the belt and the buckle do not fit well.  So I cannot really tighten the belt across the car seat and I am afraid the belt will come off and endanger the car seat.  Good thing there are also the elastic band with the red balls to secure the car seat.=========== ORIGINAL REVIEW =======I spent hundreds of hours looking for strollers for my 5 month old because we did not like our snap n go and wanted a stroller for flying this summer. I'm so happy I found the nano. Instead of buying an umbrella stroller and an everyday stroller, I am using the nano for both. Saves a lot of $$$ which my husband likes.Originally I planned to get a light umbrella for flying, then an expensive stroller like the bugaboo bee as our everyday stroller. I liked the bee because it is not huge like the Uppababy Vista that everyone has. Having a stroller with huge wheels is overkill for the mall and grocery shopping. I wanted something that will fit down the aisle easily. Some people just don't care that their stroller block the entire alise, but I care.THE NANOI have used it for two full days and love it. It's been to IKEA, Costco, the mall and the park.INFANT CAR SEATWe used it as a infant car seat frame. The seat belt attachment works great and feels very secure. It's so convenient to have a stroller that can hold a car seat and grow with the baby.The footprint of the nano is  of my baby trend snap n go. I have so much more room in my trunk now. My trunk looks almost empty.SEATI also pushed my 5 month old in the stroller without the car seat. He looked comfortable. The harness was easy to adjust and fit him. I have the seat reclined. It's not a full recline so not good for newborns but is reclined enough for a baby with good upper body strength. He fell asleep in the stroller.There is no peekaboo window but with the seat reclined you can see the baby through the mesh top of the seat.CANOPYCanopy is small but it is a compact stroller. I don't plan on using it much for outdoor activities so the canopy is fine. Also you can get the Summers Rayshade to extend the canopy.ONE HAND PUSHThe stroller is easy to push with one hand.  I had a drink in one hand and pushed the nano with car seat through a crowded supermarket and picked up a few things after dinner.FOLDUnfolding is just releasing the side lock and holding the handle. It's as easy as the video on the mountain buggy website. 2 seconds!To fold, push the two buttons on the INSIDE of the handle joint so that the handle folds down towards you. Then press the two bars together and fold forward away from you. Again, watch the instruction video.The snap n go took up half of my trunk. The nano folds to about the size of a large laptop bag and stands up! It takes up almost no room. Also you can keep the wheels on. I was able to fold it with the footrest up and the seat reclined. It will easy fit as a carry-on.For only $200 I'm so happy the nano can replace two strollers. Although I still droll at the 2014 mamas&papas; Urbo2 in navy (it's similar to the bugaboo bee) but it's $600.The nano is perfect for city and suburban dwellers. For my daily walks I have a jogger type stroller. So we only need 2 strollers!Amazon actually shipped sooner than it said it would. So I got the stroller in a week.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "SKIP THE SNAP N GO AND GET THIS - PERFECT EVERYDAY STROOLER", "unixReviewTime": 1394064000, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2014"},

It turns out, I'm not the only one with this problem. The problem is with the spring in the front wheels. When you call, explain what the problem is and they will send you a replacement kit to fix the spring system.  They told me it would only take a week or so to receive.  They already started manufacturing new strollers with the new spring system, so anyone making a brand new purchase will not come accross this issue. I heard those will be shipping out soon.  In the meantime, I am more than happy with their resolution and their prompt and courteous customer service. So if you are having this problem, I urge you to call mountain buggy directly and don't go through amazon. Now they get 5 stars for customer service. I'll be writing another update when I receive the replacement kit.Update 4/2/14:Just got back from Cancun. More in love than before with this stroller. What a breeze this is to travel with. And YES, it meets carry on requirements. I was able to take it into the airplane as a carry on. As an extra precaution, I removed the back wheels after I folded it and put them in the bag with the stroller. Extra step, but super simple to do. Everyone was amazed at how compact and easy to fold this thing was. I lived all the stares and attention we got. :-). So yes, I hugely recommend this as the best travel stroller out there. Just one minor issue I'm having. The front wheels keep locking on me and it gets very very very annoying to have to stop every 10 feet to bend down and unlocking. This is not normal and should not be happening. I don't know if it he sand from the beach got in it or what but I noticed it started happening after the first time I locked the wheels myself to go over rough terrain. I plan on contacting the company to ask questions and for repairs or replacement. I still give this stroller five starts because aside from the issue I'm experiencing, this product is amazing.Previous review:So I just took it out for a spin yesterday and I love it.  It takes up way less room in my trunk and it is so much lighter than my First Years Wave Stroller.  I ordered the nano so that I could take on vacation when we travel to Cancun and Disney this year.  I took the Wave to Belgium and it was a bit of a hassle having to take the wheels off, taking the seat off and fitting it into a huge carry bag.  They threw it in the bag and it came back super hot and damaged.  The nano supposedly meets airline policies for carry-on luggage so I hope that's true because I really don't want this one to get damaged.  I only had one little hiccup while closing it.  I wasn't used to it and forgot that I have to use the strap to tie down the hood so that it won't pop open when continuing the fold.  No biggie, it's just a matter of getting used to the folding.  The ruby color is beautiful.  The materials look and feel like they are of good quality.  When I first opened it out of the box, my almost 2 year old immediately sat in it and loved it.  She watched an entire movie sitting in it and having a snack.  The adjustable leg rest is awesome and since her legs are still too short to touch the footrest, it made it really comfortable for her.  The recline goes back really far and she looked very comfy in it so it looks good for napping.  There is an ample vent so the air can circulate.  Now the basket.  It looks small but it fits my rather large JP Lizzy tote bag.  Granted the bag wasn't full to capacity, but it had a lot of stuff in it.  It is also very easy to access through the front, which I prefer.  You can also reach in to grab stuff through the back, but it's not as easy,  which is fine with me because I think that if someone were to try and steal something it would be easiest for them through the back when the parent isn't looking.  So this is a plus for me.  This doesn't come with a bumper guard or cup holders for baby or parent which is a bummer, but it's easy to tuck a sippy cup in the basket below through the back.  The seat is also very roomy and deep, so my baby was able to sit her snack cup beside her.  When the hood was velcroed and pulled all the way up, I used that space in between as storage for her jacket and snack cup.  The handle bar is not adjustable.  I'm 5'4\" and it was very comfortable for me, but it also seems like they built it high enough to be comfortable for taller parents.  The only thing that annoys me is that if the hood is up, the parent's hands are covered by it.  Covering my hands makes me hot, so that's just my personal problem.  One of the back wheels makes a little ticking sound, but the stroller seems very stable so maybe it just needs to settle in.  What I love most is the fact that this stroller is so easy to maneuver with one hand.  I was able to open and close store doors with no problem and/or help.  The stroller is also narrow enough that it fits through small isles.  Oh, the carry bag it comes with is very handy and easy to put on.  You can even pull up the shoulder strap to carry it that way.  Ok, I think I should stop now. LOL  Hope this helps someone in making a decision since I myself was not able to find ANY reviews on it since this stroller was just released.  I was surprised to even find it on Amazon.

We've had MANY strollers pass through our household (starting with one child and now with an infant and a preschooler), mostly high-end, and this one is exceptionally well-designed for its purpose.Most &#34;travel stroller&#34; contenders will have you sacrificing features for lightweight portability. This one has struck gold with its balance of both. The lightweight/portable part is the standout feature (folds down into a small, not-too-lengthy package, unlike umbrella-type competitors, and feels like it weighs nothing next to my other strollers) but I don't feel it has sacrificed much to get there. There's a recline (albeit a strap recline vs. a bar recline, and not completely flat -- but ok by me), footrest that's way easier than most to adjust (simply compress the ends vs. buttons at the pivoting point), decent sized hood, a suspended smooth like butter ride, and a push on, push off brake. The fold is easy in two steps and ends up with a package roughly the size of an airline carry on, possibly even shorter. When folded, it locks automatically and stands by itself, and is thoughtfully designed so that when folded, there's a conveniently-located grab handle, as well as an included shoulder strap and cover.  The quality of the fabrics are great and not too cheap feeling -- excellent for the price of the stroller. Overall, the build of it is sturdy and seems much more high end than the price would suggest -- I've paid more for a stroller only to experience cheap feeling nylon and subpar details.Both of my little ones were happy to sit in the Nano and take it for a short spin upon opening, and I'm confident it will serve us well during our upcoming travels!

{"reviewerID": "A1PN0VS2GVDC7M", "asin": "B00I3YFHPI", "reviewerName": "mkks", "helpful": [23, 26], "reviewText": "I needed (wanted) a new stroller for my upcoming solo plane-train-automobile vacation with my 3 year old. I've been through more strollers than I can count in three years and have a Cybex Onyx for now (which is awesome, but heavy.) I was resigned to buying another Uppababy G-Lite since it's, you know, light, but I wasn't fond of the wheels or the sling-style seat. On a whim, I decided I should search \"stroller\" on Amazon to make sure I wasn't missing anything... AND I WAS. If you travel often with kids, you want this stroller.:: FOLD/BAG If you've watched the video, you know how small it folds. It really does fold that small- they're not exaggerating- and it folds easily without any foot action or hard work. The travel bag takes a bit of wiggling to get on but nothing really difficult. It has a carrying strap attached to the stroller, not the bag, so if you don't want to use the bag, no big deal. I can lift it with one hand or one arm easily. Despite being lightweight and small, it doesn't feel like an unstable, rickety stroller (I hated the Peg P3 and Peg Si for this reason) or like it'll fall apart if it's handled by the airline (why I got rid of my original G-Lite in the first place.):: SEAT The seat itself offers a ton of growing room. My DD measures 21\" from butt to top of head and has an amazing amount of growing room for a compact stroller. Probably close to what she has in the Onyx when the canopy is slid most of the way up. There is a strap recline which we probably won't use much, but it works like all the others. There's also the mesh backing between the top of the seat and the canopy to help with air circulation (and so the kid doesn't fall out the back when the seat is reclined, I imagine.):: WHEELS/BRAKES The wheels are buttery smooth and whipping around in tight spaces is no problem. It's obviously not an all-terrain stroller, but it can handle bumpy sidewalks and playground grass just fine without ejecting my DD. She is 3 and weighs 31 pounds and measures 37 inches and it's like I'm pushing an infant. It feels like nothing. One of very, very few things I dislike about my Onyx is how I have to really push and jam the brake on/off; this isn't the case with the Nano. By one-touch brakes, they really mean one TOUCH. It's amazing.:: CANOPY/FOOTREST The canopy isn't Onyx or G-Lite large, but it's not Volo small, either; I think the visor part helps. It would be more of an issue for smaller kids, I think, especially those who won't wear sunglasses! The adjustable fabric footrest? (legrest? I forget what it's called) is very easy to adjust (same way as the Onyx.) My DD's feet still don't quite reach the plastic footrest near the wheels (they almost reach the actual ground in the Onyx) which shows how long the stroller will last.:: HARNESS The harness- I LOVE THE HARNESS. It has 2 normal press buttons on either side but then a red button on the front for each harness piece, so you have to press both the side and the red button to release one side of the harness and then repeat for the other side. Great for escape artists. It's very easy to raise/lower the harness height; the slots are the correct height/width so you're not trying to jam the plastic piece into a hole that's too small. It's also very easy to tighten/loosen; all I had to do was pull on the tail of each side and they tightened (no double loop adjustments, thank goodness.):: BASKET The basket is nicely sized for such a compact stroller and much more easily accessible than your typical umbrella. It can fit my (thin) messenger bag and DD's Skip Hop suitcase (*loaded through the front, not the back) or a few grocery bags.:: HANDLEBAR This was my biggest worry. MB reports only 38.5\" handlebar height (non-adjustable), so I was very concerned I'd be sending the Nano back because of this. I'm 5'6\" and LOVE the ~42.5\" handlebars on the Onyx. Well, the Nano isn't going back. I don't know how they've done it, but somehow I don't feel like my back is going to die, and I don't kick the wheels. Maybe because the handlebar is angled up instead of more parallel to the ground? I don't know. Now, 6'0\"+ people may have an issue, but anyone shorter than a bit above average should be fine.:: ACCESSORIES There isn't a cupholder, so that's a bummer. I bought the Infantino Stretch organizer (in hopes that I can fold the stroller with it on) but haven't put it on yet, so I'm not sure if it'll work. (*Update: it technically fits but there's no way to actually use it because of the narrow space between the canopy and the handlebar, so I'll be hunting for something else.) The rain cover isn't included and Amazon was out of stock, so I ordered through MB and haven't received it yet. I kinda wish they'd sell the rain cover separate from the mosquito net cover since I don't think I'll ever use the latter, but oh well.

The first time I put this one one, I could feel my baby's weight completely shift to my legs. With the old Ergo, I'd still get a bit of a strain on my back with a long carry once my baby reached about 20 pounds. With this version, it's all on my legs. Not only is it easier on my back, but I can feel my legs getting a workout as well.Much more flattering. I know this is superficial, but the flat, wide belt doesn't roll or bunch, and doesn't push out your soft, squishy post-pregnancy tummy. Though I've lost my baby weight, I still have the squishy belly, and I hate it. The old ergo, when tightened properly, made my squishy tummy kind of squeeze out over the top, looking dreadful in knits. This one doesn't do that. Not sure if it's because the belt is wider or stiffer, but I'm happy not to look fat and sloppy when I'm wearing the kid.Front-facing position with hip support. I would have appreciated this more with the smaller baby, as having a big baby on front isn't always practical (these days, I mostly wear her when I need to TCB and can't have a toddler underfoot, so having her on my back and out of the way makes more sense), but she really likes the new perspective. I think it would be great for a 9-month to 1-year baby, when they're very curious and confident, but still light and small enough for a front carry not to be burdensome.The one thing I don't like about the new version is the black nap hood. I'm not comfortable putting a black cloth over the baby's head on a sunny day, even when it's cool and breezy. The older version had a light colored hood, which made much more sense.

It is light weight and does not cause me back pain or discomfort. I have used the ERGObaby 360 facing inwards and facing front outwards with my 5 month old son who weighs 19 pounds. I have yet to be able to try it with him on my hip or back since he needs to be 6 months old. I received this after he was heavier than 12 lbs, so he was past needing the infant insert. The infant insert needs to be purchased separately.The ERGObaby 360 carrier, has a narrower shape so I am able to fold it up to fit in my diaper bag. The ERGObaby has a Velcro strap that goes around your waist with an additional buckle for safety. This allows people of different sizes to use the carrier comfortably. I have used it, my wife has used it, and even my 5 ft tall mother has used it. My mother said it was more comfortable to use the ERGObaby than carrying my son in her arms because of his size. This carrier does not cause me back pain. It took me some time and repeated use to familiarize myself with the different setting and to feel at ease putting my son securely in this carrier.Some people have had trouble with the instruction manual.  The ERGObaby website has videos that link to YouTube on how to use the carrier. I found these videos to be very helpful. I had previously never used an ERGObaby carrier and the videos helped me to understand the button positioning for inward facing vs outward facing. The hip wearing video was especially useful. Since the straps need be connected in a specific way to make the carrier safe to use on your hip. What the instruction manual didn't mention was the sleeping hood.  The extendable back panel (the fabric in front that folds up for neck support when facing inwards) has a zipper compartment. When you unzip it, unrolls a thin piece of fabric with snaps on the side. When your child is facing inwards you can put this over their head to protect them from the sun or for privacy when they are sleeping or breastfeeding. The snaps attach to the snaps on your shoulder straps. It is a great feature that we have used many times.I also have a Babybjorn One carrier. The ERGObaby requires an infant insert that is sold separately in order to use it with a baby under four months. The Babybjorn One carrier has a zipper that allowed us to use it when our son was an infant. It was nice that the Babybjorn goes from infant to 33lbs without any additional accessories. I really like both carriers and use them both frequently.  For both carriers, you need to hold the carrier with one arm and place the baby in with the other arm.  When inserting the baby into the carrier, I feel the Babybjorn is more secure with the extra buckles. But once the baby is properly in, both carriers feel secure. I highly recommend both.If you are looking at getting an ERGObaby carrier, get the 360 carrier. I like that the ERGObaby has the bucket shape for the baby's hips and spine. Being able to carrier your baby in so many different positions makes it worth the money. It is comfortable and easy to use. The sleeping hood shields my son when sleeping from prying eyes and the sun. It is lightweight and when used properly securely holds my son.

An Infantino Sash Mei Tai (Mei Tai), and three different Ergobaby carriers&#8212;Original Organic, 360, and the Performance (Ventus Graphite). I started out with the Mei Tai and the Ergobaby Original carriers. My parents, my husband, and I all took turns wearing the baby. After a few weeks, my mom and I preferred the MeiTai and my dad and husband preferred the Ergobaby original.There are several reasons why I don&#8217;t like the Ergobaby Original.1. Did not fit well on those with petite frames-my mom and I are under 5&#8217;2&#8221;. The Ergobaby Original was too long, sat awkwardly/uncomfortably low on our hips, and covered most of our torso. My dad who is 5&#8217;7&#8221; and my husband who is 5&#8217;11&#8221; did not have these issues.2. Unflattering for the post-partum body. I was 135 pre-pregnancy and 160 after. The hip/waist belt squishes my post-partum belly fat in all directions creating very unsightly rolls. I could never take this out in public.3. Cannot put on/take off without assistance. The buckle across the back is out of the wearer&#8217;s reach4. Hot. Wearing a huge padded all cotton &#8220;front&#8221;pack with a baby in it that covers half of our petite frame in the middle of scorching August, was intolerable.5. The attached hood used to cover the baby&#8217;s head cannot be removed, tucked away, or secured to the carrier. It just hangs/dangles and gets in the way.6. No forward facing for baby. Babies like to look around the world once they are old enough to be aware. We stopped using out Ergobaby Original because there was no front facing option to let baby see where she is going. And She didn&#8217;t want to be in it anymore after she about 4 to 5 months old.Now that I have the new Ergobaby 360 and Performance carriers, I think Ergobaby tried to addressed some of the Original&#8217;s shortcomings.Ergobaby 360:1. New design accommodates those with petite frames better and still good for bigger/taller family members. I noticed the baby&#8217;s weight is shifted too. It rides lower and not as much on your back and shoulders. More comfortable for all, including baby.2. The stiffer and wider hip belt is more flattering. It doesn&#8217;t push out my post-partum belly as much to form rolls and ugly muffin top like the original.3. Still cannot put on/take off without assistance. There is still a buckle strap across the back that you will need someone to help you fasten and unfasten.4. Less hot. The new carrier is smaller and cut differently. Both wearer and baby is better ventilated.5. The hood no longer gets in the way or dangles unattractively.6. Allows forward facing and side hip wearing that the Ergobaby Original didn&#8217;t allow before. At 11 months, baby returned willingly back into the carrier.Ergobaby Performance (Ventus Graphite):1. This design is still a big large for petite people but because the carrier is so thing and part of it is mesh, it is still more comfortable overall compared to the Ergobaby Original. Dad and husband like this one, too. The shoulder straps are thinner and less padded than Original or 360. More like a backpack. But the weight distribution is comfortable.2. I like the fit better than the Original. And this carrier is very sporty and attractive. But I still like the 360 for my body size and shape.3. Still cannot put on/take off without assistance. There is still a buckle strap across the back that you will need someone to help you fasten and unfasten.4. The thinness and lightness of the carrier and the mesh down the front really helps everyone stay ventilated.5. The hood no longer gets in the way or dangles unattractively.6. Does not allow forward facing. But does allow for side hip wearing. Disappointing because if I want to take baby on a quick hike in the hills behind my house, she cannot face forward.Ergobaby makes good carriers. That&#8217;s why they are so popular and well-loved. I have friends that swear by them. But let&#8217;s be honest, they are very expensive. If you are a new parent and don&#8217;t know how much you will enjoy wearing your baby and how much use you will get out of your carrier, I would recommend the Infantino Mei Tai. It is perfect for wearing around the house in those early months to help free up your hands to make a quick sandwich or do some laundry. You can still take your baby out in it and see if you both like wearing/being in carriers. It&#8217;s only $25-$30 compared to the Ergobaby carriers that run 4 to 5 times as much. Then if you decide baby carriers are for you, I believe there is an Ergobaby perfect for everyone.

She literally squeals of delight when she sees me or my wife start to put it on. Since she was about 6 months when we got it, she&#8217;s only used it outward-facing. For me, the best part of the carrier is that the leg holes have some flex so she&#8217;s not having to sit in a fixed spread eagle position! In addition to the &#8216;bucket seat&#8217;, this makes the carrier probably the most comfortable for the baby that I&#8217;ve seen.  The cotton material is very soft, breathes well, and is sturdy, yet light.For extended walks/trail hiking, I kept returning to my BECO Gemini since the straps cross in the back so the weight is well-distributed. As the heat of summer is upon us, my daughter gets too warm in the Gemini and I&#8217;m now using the ERGObaby 360 exclusively. I find the 360&#8217;s design adapts well to many body shapes of the wearer. Me (5&#8217;11&#8221;), my wife (5&#8217;9&#8221;)  and our main sitter (5&#8217;5&#8221;) can wear it comfortably. The extra clip along the waist strap helps to really secure things in place. The first few times I used the carrier, my daughter did startle from the sound of the velcro being loosened. After removing her from the carrier and making sure she&#8217;s safely sitting on the floor, I take a few steps away in order to take off the waist belt and lift it carefully to try to minimize sound.Overall, the versatility and construction of the 360 are top-notch!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best of the ERGO line!", "unixReviewTime": 1405814400, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2014"},

Since writing the review, the lag is so bad, it takes several minutes to switch or recognize the device. If I am viewing the outdoor camera and need to switch to my daughter's bedroom, it just does not compute. And if it does, it takes several minutes! Also, controlling the outdoor camera, there is such a lag, it is almost useless. My daughter went on a walk with her grandpa last night and I was hoping to watch them walk down the driveway but the camera would not move. It finally did after they were out of view. Speaking of above, most cameras I have that have add on cameras, you can view all of the cameras on one screen, split or whatnot. With this one, you can only view one. That might be a deal breaker for some.When I ordered this, I did not know what to expect. I have used Motorola products before and have been impressed by them but I have not tried a baby monitor or camera by them.Opening the box it is very simple to understand what plugs in where and what tools you will need. You will need a small Philips head screwdriver for the battery case on the monitor and a drill to mount the outdoor camera. The cords are coded with an icon of the cameras which is very easy to understand where it plugs in. I appreciate the longer cords. Both the monitor and indoor camera have longer cords that I am not used to. I am used to Lorex cameras and they have black cords and are not as long. These have white cords which blend nicely into my interior. The outdoor camera has a black cord which is perfect to keep it out of sight.I want to point out the outdoor camera is NOT weatherproof, it is weather resistant. The camera itself is inside a glass dome, it is not meant to be in direct contact with the elements. I thought about placing it on my deck but there is not enough coverage from the rain if a storm comes in. Not only would you ruin the camera you will not be able to see anything if the glass dome gets wet. I can't express it enough; weather resistant means you need to have some sort of protection from the elements. I have a front covered porch with two windows. Both windows have black shutters. I drilled it into the black shutter and it blends in nicely. I placed it there because it was well covered under the porch and also the power supply could be plugged in underneath. I tucked the wiring under the shutter and it looks very nice. With the indoor camera I mounted it above my toddler's window (inside) facing her room. Again, there was an outlet right below it.Once the cameras are plugged in, they pair instantly. I believe I read that you can't turn down the volume. I was able to turn down the volume on mine, on the monitor. However, if the camera and the monitor are out of range, it will beep to alert you. I am used to seeing `out of range' on the monitor but this one beeps instead and has a Motorola logo on the screen, you will know you lost the connection.Visibility during the day is amazing! The outdoor camera, you control it from the monitor. It turns left, right, up, and down with the buttons on the left. I have noticed there is a huge lag and sometimes it takes awhile before it moves. However, where the camera is placed, I can see the sides of the house from both sides of the camera, zoom in 2X! You can move it up and down; I am very impressed with how far the camera moves. You will hear a little whirling sound on both cameras when it is controlled with the monitor. At night the outdoor camera, the infrared is just good, not great. You can make things out but not that well. I keep the porch light on so anything on the porch I can see perfectly. If I turn it out, the night vision icon comes on and you can tell it is grainy. The indoor camera has decent night vision, I can tell if my daughter is in bed but if you need to move the camera, it does whirl as stated above and might wake the child.If you need to take the monitor around it has a kickstand and antenna to take from room to room. With the click of the `OK' button it changes from each camera. Again, there can be a lag and it takes almost a minute before the button realizes it needs to switch over to the other camera, annoying but not enough to do anything about.What I do not like:* As stated above, there is a lag when you move the camera around. That annoys me if my daughter is running around and the camera will not move.* Range is good, could be better. Oddly enough, the farther away I am, the better it works. There must be some sort of obstruction because I can be a few feet from the outdoor camera on the other side of the wall and I have nothing on the monitor. Again, it does not state `out of range' but will beep and show the Motorola logo. If I go to the back of the house, it works. No rhyme of reason. I have other devices that work in that room so I am not sure what the interference is.* The color on the monitor at night is nothing impressive. During the day, both cameras are excellent!If you need to put the monitor in standby mode, all you do is tap the power button and it puts it in standby. One touch back on it and it is on! I like this feature since you don't have to power the whole unit down. Perfect if on your nightstand and you need to turn the camera on in a second.All and all I am very impressed. I did not think the monitor size would be big enough. I have another one that is 5 inches so I thought the 3.5 would be too small, not the case. It seems perfect. It is a well designed monitor.I am going to give it a solid 4 stars. The fact that is does not always transmit and the night vision is lackluster, I am taking away a star. However, it is still a wonderful system. I have used this for a few weeks and plan to update my review if anything changes.I also wanted to add it does have an AV out. Someone noted that you can't hook this up to a TV, I believe with this cableMotorola Audio Visual Cable for MBP 33 and MBP36 Digital Video Baby Monitors, it would work.

There is only VERY slight &#8216;lag&#8217; when hitting the button and when the camera moves.-The row of lights at the top which indicate volume level where the monitor is.  This is FANTASTIC.  As a parent, you can continue to watch TV, talk to your partner, etc without constantly worrying about keeping the noise level down to hear properly.  The row of lights will simply alert you of any sound.-The outdoor camera includes all the appropriate hardware to set it up and is weather proof.  It survived a windy rain storm so far without any issues.  I installed mine to overlook the front door so I could see who was out there when I was upstairs or running around.-Literally, out of the box and you&#8217;re done set up.  The only item you really have to install is the outdoor camera.  The indoor camera/monitor is already ready to go and paired out of the box.Cons:-The cycle of the cameras (indoor/outdoor) timing cannot be changed.  You only have one choice (12 seconds).  I would have liked some customization here.  For example, on the indoor camera for a minute, then on the outside one for a quick 5 seconds or something similar.-The range.  This is probably house/environment particular, but I was only able to get a little less than 50 feet through walls in my home.

I also now have two of these in by backseat(forward facing).First, the pros:-Incredibly easy installation and removal. When I drop my daughters off with their babysitter, I also have to drop off the carseats. It takes me 3-5 minutes tops to get both carseats uninstalled. Takes slightly longer, like 7-10 minutes to reinstall, but only because I climb into the car to put weight on both carseats to tighten accurately.-It's comfortable, and that's straight from my 4 year old's mouth. Her old carseat(a Safety 1st model) felt incredibly hard and the straps always dug in. This carseat is much better. I drove from the East Coast to the West Coast and she was very happy in her carseat and fell asleep.-Strap adjustment and replacement(if you had the one before the recall), is simple. If you are having issues with uncomfortable straps, I strongly recommend buying strap covers. There are pink ones that match this carseat too!-Lightweight. I am listing this as a pro because I frequently have to remove and carry these carseats when I drop off my children. I can carry both easily.-It's actually an incredibly cute design.Cons:-The old straps that came with this carseat before there was a recall had an issue where they would loosen, or the buckles would get stuck. Don't worry--this model comes with the new straps, and Evenflo will send you replacements for free if you have the one before the recall.-Bulky. While I can have two of these installed in my backseat, they swallow my backseat. Luckily I only have two kids and I don't need to use the middle seat. I can still fit a diaper bag and/or purse between the seats and that works fine. Because of the bulkiness, however, I imagine that installing this carseat in the rearfacing position might be an issue. My car is compact so that's mostly why I bring it up.I will amend my review if any issues pop up.

Original review is still up on my public profile.&#34;I bought this seat so my daughter could stay rear-facing for longer, plus I loved the design of the Nicole. It rear faces up to 40lbs and 40in, and forward faces up to 65lbs and 54in. My 3 1/2 year old son is just about to grow out of his convertible, an Evenflo Tribute V, and the Tribute forward faces for as long as the Sureride rear faces. Think about that for a second. With higher weight and height limits for both rear and forward facing, of course it's going to be bigger. It has to accommodate bigger children after all. I don't know why I wasn't expecting it to be monstrously huge, though. With those numbers, if you're going to get it for a newborn, infant, or young toddler, expect the seat to expire before they grow out of it while forward facing.I have yet to actually install it in my car, a '07 Jeep Liberty. I have memo---nightmares from almost 3 years ago from just trying to get the tribute to fit rear facing. It's definitely better suited for a mini van. I will update this review periodically.*EDIT*The car seat didn't actually take up as much room in my car as I was afraid it was going to. The front seat can't be back all the way like my husband likes it, but it does leave a comfortable amount of room. I'm not exactly a short woman, either. It is rather difficult to install, but no more than most convertible car seats in the rear facing position. I'm planning on getting it checked out by a tech just in case. If you have problems installing you car seat(s), I suggest you visit your local inspection site as well. I've had no problems with the harness or buckles, and my daughter has had no problem falling asleep in it.&#34;June 5, 2014, I would like to add a few things. The car seat is huge, no doubt about it, but don't be afraid. You do not have to have a huge vehicle in order for the car seat to fit. It fit in my old vehicle, a 2007 Jeep Liberty. When I went searching for a more fuel efficient car, fitting my car seats was a deal breaker. Surprisingly, it also fit (while rear-facing) a 2012 Honda Fit with my 5'11 husband able to comfortably sit in front of it. If you are not familiar, a Honda Fit is a subcompact car, much much smaller than an SUV. Unfortunately we were recently involved in a bad automobile accident that totalled the new car. I do not recommend subcompact cars now knowing they don't tend to fair well in accidents due to their small size, but I do recommend this seat as well as my son's booster (Evenflo Maestro). They held up very well, and our insurance will be replacing with the same models. Also, the date this was manufactured, I did not receive a model with a recalled buckle, explaining why I never had a problem with the buckle sticking. If you have purchased this seat, make sure to check the Evenflo website to make certain you do not have a recalled buckle.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It's a Monster", "unixReviewTime": 1401926400, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2014"},

I've used two other swings and feel like I've seen countless others between family, friends, and taking care of other's children. It's important to note that not all babies like swings. My first and third children LOVED the swing and would spend hours upon hours relaxing and sleeping in them. My middle child would not have it, no matter which swing she was in, she just didn't like it. That said, if you're planning on having more than one child, I consider a swing to be a worth-while investment. One child may not take to it, but for the kids who DO like them, the swing is GOLD. So helpful to young parents.The Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing is truly the Cadillac of baby swings. Before owning one, I thought they looked overly large and silly in photos. Then I read reviews and decided to get one for ourselves, and I'm so glad we did. This newer model is the second one we've owned and it seems to have a more powerful motor (doesn't need to be pushed to really get going) and maybe a little sturdier. Our other recent model could be a tad squeaky. I'd have to &#34;adjust&#34; it sometimes while running and baby was sleeping in it, because it'd start to squeak while running.It's soft and cozy and in a great position for babies, especially those who are colicky. The mirror and mobile offer a great entertainment for babies wanting to chill out and rest. My baby often fell asleep for hard naps while in this swing. The music is great, and the volume can be controlled. The motor is quiet, especially once the swing really gets going, it seems even quieter. The design is neutral and attractive. It is actually not as obtrusive as the photo might look. This swing is nice and big, but not at all TOO big.The baby can swing in two directions, you can easily set it to side-to-side or turn it so baby goes front-to-back. My baby liked both. He would nap in this swing for a good long time and it was such a blessing to have. I'd definitely recommend this swing. As another reviewer put it, this is the best swing out there.

This is the fifth, yes fifth Fisher-Price cradle swing I have owned.  The first one was from thirteen years ago and had just three speeds and no fancy bells or whistles like sounds or motorized mobile.  It was basic and it was great.  I used it for my first two children and then passed it on to a friend who used it for her baby.  The second one was a papasan swing that I brought second hand at a yard sale for our third child.  The swing had already gone through two children and was used briefly for my third baby and then passed on to another friend who got a ton of use out of it and passed it back to me for my nephew.  The third swing, and the one I like best is the aquarium swing that a friend gave us for our third baby.  I prefer that one because it has an a/c adaptor and has the same excellent construction as our original cradle swing.  The fourth one, was the Rainforest swing which is a current Fisher Price swing and one which I recommend you absolutely avoid (you can find my review of that swing by clicking on my name at the top of this review).  Now let's move on to the review of this Snuggabunny swing.I was really excited when I found out I was going to have the opportunity to review this swing.  It has neutral colors, much like the papasan swing I had picked up at a yard sale, which meant it would blend in perfectly with my living room and family room decor, and best of all it had an a/c adaptor so I wouldn't have to worry about keeping a steady supply of batteries on hand. As with the Rainforest swing, this one is also a bit of a bear to assemble.Assembly for this swing is a bit of a pain in the rear, but not quite as bad as the Rainforest model.  I have assembled three older versions of Fisher-Price cradle swings with relative ease. They all snapped and screwed together in roughly five to ten minutes with zero frustration.  This swing and the rainforest one, however are not nearly as easy to assemble.I'm less than thrilled with the overall construction of the swing, like the rainforest model, it also seems very flimsy when compared to previous Fisher-Price cradle swings.  The swing motor is a bit loud, but every cradle swing we've had from Fisher-Price has been a bit loud so I wouldn't hold the noise against it.  As the swing swings, the legs lift up a bit and that concerns me.  Because I question the stability of the swing, I will continue to keep my aquarium swing at the ready for the time when I need full size swing for my little one.  Presently he's very content to hang out in our very portable and well constructed Ingenuity portable swing.The music for the swing is ok.  It's not overly annoying but it's not something I'd forsee using in my house. I found the nature sounds to be better than the music.  The mobile is cute and much nicer to look at than the rainforest model.  I really dislike the mirrored dome.  It will give baby a distorted view of him/herself.  I much perfer the dome like the one on the aquarium swing to this one.The seat pad is nice and plush.  The head rest can be moved up and down to accommodate babies of differing heights, but it's pretty thin and isn't going to help prevent flat spots on baby's head.  I'd do wish the bunny headrest for seat pad was removable so a head rest like the Boppy Noggin Nest could be used instead.  The seat pad is gender neutral.  I prefer gender neutral baby gear so you don't find yourself swimming in say all pink baby gear from your first baby only to have to go out and buy all new stuff if you have a boy next.So the bottom line on this swing is it's better than the rainforest model, but I would look around to see if there's a better quality swing out there. If you have your heart set on a swing that can go head to toe or sided to side take a look at other manufacturers to see if they have a cradle swing with better construction.  If you think you can get by with a swing that just swing from head to toe I'd recommend you take a look at the Comfort and Harmony portable swings.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fisher Price Cradle Swings Aren't What They Used To Be", "unixReviewTime": 1405468800, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2014"},

While you want to know that you are getting a good product when you buy this swing (you are), you also might be pleasantly surprised to find out that you are getting excellent customer service as well. For the most part, we haven't had any issues with our swings. But there have been two occasions when we've needed to call customer service:  once when the motor died after using the swing for a year, and once when the motor was faulty right out of the box. In BOTH cases, a quick and painless call to customer service resulted in a brand new motor for the first, older swing, and an entirely new swing to replace the brand new but faulty one. Honestly, Fisher Price's customer service cannot be beat. They really are exceptional.As for the swing itself, this Snugabunny version is my favorite one to date. The swing is easy-peasy to set up and is solidly constructed. The motor is so, so quiet, even when starting up--and it gets swinging pretty quickly. I like the updated control panel; the buttons are simple and easy to operate. The mobile works as it should and is quiet.The music settings sound a bit tinny, but my baby doesn't seem to mind. There are several volume levels, too, which is nice. I was worried that the reflective &#34;mirror&#34; surface in the center of the mobile would distract my baby and keep him from sleeping, but he has no problem looking at himself a while and then settling in to sleep. (Yes, we have let all three of our kids use the swing to fall asleep. It really does soothe a crying newborn, so this swing is a godsend, if you ask me.)Overall, I love this product.

I highly recommend this swing from Fisher Price.The Snugabunny swing has 6 swinging levels. The seat adjusts very easily for side-to-side or forwad-to-back swinging. It plays nature sounds and various lullabies. My favorite part about this swing and all the other The Fisher Price swings is that their cradles are outfitted with the plushest fabrics and cushioning. It's like putting baby in a cloud.The Snugabunny is great. Gender neutral colors. And come with an AC adaptor so that you can plug it in and don't have to always run it on D batteries. This for me is a BIG deal because I also have the Fisher Price My Little Lamb swingFisher-Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lambwhich is completely the same as the Snugabunny except that My Little Lamb only takes batteries. Very annoying. I also have the Graco Glider XL Gliding swingGraco Glider LX Gliding Swing, Raffywhich is really nice and great if you don't have as much floor space because the Fisher Price swings will take up a bit of real estate, but my main compliant with the Graco Glider is that the cradle is not plush and does not have padding at all.A swing is definitely one of those items that will save your life when your baby is still in the newborn/infant phase and I highly recommend getting one to anyone who is considering adding a swing to their collection of infant care tools. And the Fisher Price swings, in my opinion, are some of the best you can buy in terms of quality and price, backed by a solid company (Mattel).When I was expecting my first child and asked my mommy friends whether I needed to by a cradle/bassinet/Moses basket for my infant, most told me-- NO. They told me to let my baby sleep in the cradle of the swing (you cannot do this for babies who are rolling). So my own baby napped and slept in a Fisher Price swing for the first couple weeks of her life in the \"off\" mode, of course. We would swaddle her and put her in. And I could easily turn the music, nature sounds, or the swing on when she would cry and fuss. It worked like a charm just as my friends said and I save money on not buying an extra cradle/bassinet/Moses basket. After those first couple of weeks, we transitioned her to her crib but continued to use the swing as entertainment and as a soother. I didn't use my swing as much as my friend who had two colicky babies. But it was helpful to have a swing handy all the same.

After your baby has nursed, burped, played, clean diaper and still refuses to sleep - this is the perfect time to put them in the swing.  If baby is not yet ready to sleep, she'll still hang out in the swing for 10-20 min.  If she's ready to sleep, it'll rock her to sleep in about 15 minutes.  She has slept in it for a couple of hours at a time.  This has made it so I am able to get some sleep myself, take a shower, eat, do some chores, etc..  A total lifesaver.What I like about the swing:- It's sturdy- Does not take up too much room- Attractive, gender neutral colors that go well with any decor- Quiet- Works reliably- Baby loves it- Has a mirror up top that Baby absolutely loves to look at.  Whenever I put her in the swing, she immediately looks up at the mirror.  Then the moving toys is an extra plus.- Has a very nice 5-point harness which is a must have.  There is a soft padded piece that comes up between Baby's legs, then a strap comes over from either side of the waist for a very secure waist hold.  Or you can attach the shoulder straps as well for even more security.  I use the waist straps only when I'm in the room with her and watching.  I use the additional shoulder straps if I'm going to be stepping out of the room and only monitoring her with the video monitor.- Whole thing is very nicely padded and soft, comfy and cushy.- Places Baby in a very nice position which she sometimes prefers to laying flat on her back, this makes it easier for her to fall asleep when she has some gas issues.- Great swing speeds.  Just fast enough for her to enjoy.  If the swing is too slow it's not effective at all.  I find the speeds offered are just perfect.  Sometimes I will lower the speed once she is asleep, but sometimes she will wake up when I do this so I think she definitely prefers the faster speeds- Wall plug or battery operated- You can turn it so Baby is swinging side to side or front to back.- Easy to put Baby in and lift out againWhat I don't like:- Only the strap that come up between her legs has an additional soft padding between the hard nylon strap/buckle and Baby.  The other 2 waist straps and 2 shoulder straps are just plain hard nylon.  Most of the time Baby is naked with just a diaper on and so the hard nylon straps are right up against her skin.  I don't like that.  It would have been easy to use a softer strap material or added the same padding to the other straps as well.  I don't strap Baby in it tight so it's not like it *really* matters, I just still don't like it.  Nothing but the softest things should be right up against Baby's skin!!  LOL- There was one time when the motor was clicking with every rock.  Something must've gotten unbalanced in there.  I turned it on and off and nothing worked.  It was still swinging, but there was a loud click with each swing.  It still worked, so I kind of ignored it.  Then the next time I used it, there was no noise again so it somehow fixed itself.  I have an older swing, same manufacturer, that still swings but creaks and clicks a lot - it's very loud.  It still works but is loud and sometimes it stops for no reason, but I can start it back up again.  So I do believe that sometimes there may be a problem with the motor.  But I haven't had a problem with this one other than that one hiccup and I still think it's a great product.Wonderful product, Must Have, Definitely Recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Must Have Baby Product", "unixReviewTime": 1405900800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2014"},

After my grandson arrived, I quickly changed my mind about bouncers. This is definitely an essential piece of equipment for any little one - and an even more essential piece of equipment for the adults caring for the baby.  The &#8220;Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Sensory Stages Bouncer&#8221; is even better than previous iterations of the bouncer and one that my new granddaughter loves &#8211; as do the adults in the family.Like all Fisher-Price products, the &#8220;Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Sensory Stages Bouncer&#8221; is an excellent quality item. The plastic edges are smooth; they should not injure your infant.  The colorful cloth seating area is nicely finished and the fabric is not cheap or scratchy.  The aqua shades are bright, but not garish.  If necessary and it will be, the cover removes easily for washing.The inclined seat is very useful if your little one suffers from reflux since keeping the baby upright, after feeding, for the 15 - 30 minutes your doctor may recommend can be tiring if the baby is large or it is o-dark-thirty at night.  Further, the incline is also nice because once your baby is a bit older and staying awake more, you can move the seat between rooms as you go about your daily life. This allows the baby to observe different environments and allows you to explain your activities so that the baby's language learning can advance.We found the vibrating feature helpful when the baby was fussy or when she was having difficulty going to sleep. It was soothing and helped calm her down.  When she was awake, the ability to &#8220;bounce&#8221; provided exercise and entertainment; it also helped strengthen muscles that were not yet ready for crawling.The two-sided, arched toy that can be attached is very nice feature. Unless you turn on the music or motion, the actions/tunes do not &#34;go&#34; continually, but require that the baby do something to activate the music, motion, or toys. This is particularly nice if you are an individual who dislikes the continuous, automated music of some infant toys.  On one side of the arch, the high contrast design and the mirror are excellent for the youngest users.  Once your little one is a bit older, the second side&#8217;s colorful parts are eye-catching and stimulate your baby's visual sense; they are bright, but not gaudy.Although rated for up to 25 lbs., the &#8220;Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Sensory Stages Bouncer&#8221; is useful up to about 20 pounds.  At that point, the baby's weight is sufficient to prevent the upright position from being particularly useful.  You may find, as I did, the &#8220;Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Sensory Stages Bouncer&#8221; is essential for any parent or caregiver - it fills a number of useful functions, is well made, and little ones love it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Essential For Your Nursery Or For Grandma's House ...", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2014"},

It immediately snaps shut and would especially be a great storage space for a diaper.A bottle or can of soda fits well in the organizer, but at first I was worried about a taller metal water bottle.  One other organizer I had was a bit iffy in that department.  No problem because the holders are a full 6\" deep.  They are about 3-1/2\" wide and the fit was perfect, even for the wide Munchkin bottles I have.The reinforcement is really good.

The night before I left it plugged in across the room on my dresser.  With our old Angelcare, the battery always lasted through the night (8 hours or less) but the VTech monitor was off when I woke up.  WTH?  Turned it back on and saw the low battery.  Nice.  Good thing my child is a sound-sleeping toddler who rarely wakes, and not an infant in need of several feedings in the night.  I will go back to my Angelcare.We tried it the next day during nap time, and the battery started to die (after a full charge) in under 3 hours.Original Review:We were using an Angelcare basic sound monitor, nothing special, before getting this.  The Angelcare's audio is still working after 2 years, but the display is no longer functioning.  We switched to this a few nights ago and I like it better.*The sound quality is good.  We use a noise machine in our son's room and the Angelcare always sounded very echo-ey.  With this VTech, the noise machine sounds like it's sitting on our dresser.  I can clearly hear my son if he makes any noise in the room.*The video display is good for this price point, but still mediocre.  The angle is not wide enough and takes some careful positioning.  I have nothing to compare it to, but I would imagine if you spent more on it you'd get better video. You can definitely tell what you're looking at, but it reminds me a bit of looking at an ultrasound picture when the room is dark.  You can make out his head and see him moving.  I don't know what I expected.  In any case, this is not a feature I require, so any video is nice to have.  I'm not sure how useful this would be with an infant.  My son is 2.  It is nice to see if he's in there standing up if he makes a sound, or if maybe he's just dreaming.*Very easy to hook up.  I made no adjustments to it and just turned it on.  It was dead out of the box and needed a charge, but we have not lost reception anywhere in our 1900 sq, foot house.  Our Angelcare had a cradle charger, and I do miss that, but the simple A/C plug works fine, too.*Talk back feature is nice.  Haven't used it yet, but I like having the option.  Especially for when my son jumps to his big boy bed.  Again, not sure if this would be useful for an infant.I have this sitting on a dresser, so I have not tried a wall or ceiling mount, but I would imagine you'd get better visuals if you did that.  As it is, I can see my son through the crib bars, but it's not the best line of sight.Overall, I think this is a great and inexpensive video monitor, and I think it's more than adequate for most people's needs.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Battery died sometime in the night after a full charge", "unixReviewTime": 1403654400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2014"},

I was exciting when I ordered it through the Vine program. I have recently taken physical custody of my mischievous 3-year-old grandchild. I wanted to be able to keep an eye on her when I wasn't able to be in the same room with her and I found this product to be a bit difficult to use. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and to this day, I cannot get it to work on my phone. I've uninstalled and re-installed the required app and when I try to start it, it switches my wif-fi to 4G which can be pricey if it exceeds my data plan. I utilized the mini disc that came with it and it was just worthless. When you click on the many resources and apps it says are on the disc, it takes you to the company's website. One of the resources on the disc is supposed to be the user manual, which takes you to the Lorex website, and for the life of me, I cannot find a user manual anywhere on it.I wasn't going to give up, so I tried the app from the Google Play store on my husband's Motorola Razr and it works just fine. I then tried downloading it on my iPad and first had problems, but was finally able to find the app by going through the Play Store through Google Search, because when I tried to put in the name of the app directly through the Play Store, it says app not found. I eventually got it to work on my iPad, but after about an hour it told me it couldn't locate my camera or it couldn't connect to the internet. Very irritating.Enough about my irritation, I will say that while connected to my husband's phone, the video is excellent. There is a delay from time to time but overall it has a good photo.

I've done several temperature readings in a row, and each one of them ave me a slightly different result. Sometimes results were close to each other, but sometimes they differed by more than a degree. The results also varied with the ear that I used, also sometimes by a whole degree.

We didn't buy ours till four months, but we definitely could have used it at two! Of course, you have to know your own baby...a baby who prefers to sleep most of the time who hasn't yet developed much muscle tone should never be in a jumper or any kind of baby seat. But our kiddo came out of the womb with great neck support (really, the nurses were amazed), so you really just have to know what your own baby is capable of!Only jumper on the market truly designed to be ergonomic. Not that other jumpers are all bad, but if you really want one designed with baby's development in mind, it's an easy choice.Environmentally friendly. Seriously. This thing is made mostly of canvas, bungee and steel, with only a few very small plastic parts (good sturdy plastic, not cheapo flimsy plastic) and it comes packaged in a flat cardboard box barely bigger than an LP cover. A far cry from the big plastic things that come in huge boxes with lots of styrofoam packaging. And it can be reused for several children.Machine washable. Need I say more?Very durable. I was concerned that the snaps might come undone, but these snaps are heavy duty. They're not going anywhere! The fabric is also very thick and well sewn. The construction is really quite impressive.Easily transportable. Order a couple of extra hooks, or pick some up at the hardware store, and you can easily move it from room to room, or to Grandma's house, or wherever.  I haven't used the Kling Klamp, but we didn't have a need for it. If screwed securely into an overhead wooden beam, the hook isn't going anywhere! My hubby tested it by hanging from the hook himself before we hung the jumper from it. I recommend this, since you want to make sure that not only is the hook secure in the beam, but the beam itself is secure on the ceiling. Probably especially a good idea in older homes.Easily adjustable as baby grows.Excellent customer service. I contacted the manufacturer to order more hooks and discuss the possibility of getting a second fabric seat, and they were extremely helpful.And of course the best part: the babies LOVE it! At least our little guy sure did. Bouncing is fun! There are no bells and whistles, but I just attached little teething toys and crinkle toys to it with those plastic link thingees...kept him busy for quite awhile!Cons:Only one, that it's really not terribly easy to get baby in and out of. It takes some getting used to. But once you get the hang of it, it is so, so worth it! And honestly this fact actually makes me feel even more confident about baby's safety...if I have a bit of a hard time getting him in and out, he's definitely not going to work himself out of it!Overall, I highly recommend. Worth the money (and if you don't have that kind of money, I'm sure you could find one secondhand...really, it's that great!) I'm looking forward to using it for our second baby on the way!Update, 2013: We moved into a new home, and the beam we screwed this into for our second baby had a layer of plaster coating. Because of this, we did not notice that the hook was slowly twisting its way out of the beam, which had NOT happened in our apartment! The hook fell one day and our little son fell, and was upset, but was not hurt (wasn't a long fall to the floor, and we had a mat underneath). He loved this bouncer so much, though, we decided to figure out a better way...our doors were too narrow for the Kling Klamp to be practical, so instead we bought an extra hook. We screwed both hooks into the beam as securely as humanly possible, right next to each other, and hung the chain from BOTH hooks. The two hooks linked by the chain prevent one another from twisting, and if one somehow manages to let go anyway, the other is there as backup. We've had no more problems.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great investment. Update: Two hooks are better than one!", "unixReviewTime": 1349308800, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2012"},

He likes being able to turn around and see everything in the room.We didn't have a door frame with a good location, so we just put the hook into a stud in the ceiling in our living room. This gives little buddy plenty of room to jump around, and the whole family can sit and watch him.

After much research, I bought one for my twins when they were 5 months old.  At first, I was a bit disappointed.  It looked so homemade out of some fabric and stuff picked up at the local hardware store, and my boys just sort of hung there in it and didn't try to bounce much at all.  They only liked it if somebody sat there and bounced them or swung them very gently.  BUT NOW, at almost 8 months, both of them have a blast jumping in this.  My \"older\" bigger twin who is generally a bit ahead of my little guy LOVES the jumper and I think he would stay there all day if I let him.  They both enjoy it so much that I decided to buy a second jumper.  It is expensive, but very much worth it, and this provides much more entertainment and exercise than an exersaucer or jumperoo (plus it takes up much less space, which is at a premium in our house).  I highly recommend this jumper.A few tips:  1. Take the time to adjust the jumper properly the first time.  There are videos online that will guide you through the setup if you need some help.  2.  Put something soft on the floor for baby to jump on.  We were using a foam exercise mat, but now we have a memory foam bathmat there, and both my boys love it.  3.  Don't assume you have to stop using this when your child learns to walk.  The weight limit is 40 pounds.  We tried this out with my 18 month old, 25 pound niece and she had a blast in it too.**Update:  My twins are now almost 15 months old and about 30 pounds and they still enjoy jumping in their Merry Muscles bouncers!

I am sure that it strengthens his leg and stomach muscles and teaches him to find his balance.  I was going to shop for a thing that can assist your baby to walk (moon walker) but I just realized that I can use this Merry Muscles for that same task by just attaching some strings and a harness type thing to hold up above him so that he can walk unassisted but completely supported.This bouncer is definitely worth spending the money.

It was SUPER easy to assemble, no tools required, and just as easy to disassemble. It's very light weight too so it's easy to move about your home.  The idea you can hook up your ipod to it for music was great too. The &#34;nature&#34; sounds were okay and the volume levels were good! The plush material is really nice too.I was sure this bouncer would be the answer to my prayers. Having a baby (2 mo old) that LOVES to move, bounce, swing and be held. After seeing it work in the store, I thought the HIGH setting would be sufficient, however I was WRONG! the low setting is VERY VERY slow. The lowest 3 settings vibrated my baby, which would be okay if I WANTED a vibrating seat ALL the time. So I used the highest setting most of the time. Now, the highest setting, once my baby was in the seat, didn't move as &#34;fast&#34; or with the oomph like I had hoped it was going to.

The highest headrest position can only be used with the booster and this isn&#8217;t labeled at all so you might need to pull it all the way up and then make sure you slide it down a notch.Getting it into the car (or van) is pretty simple with LATCH.  It works like most other LATCH friendly seats.  The front of the base comes right to the front of our seat so it&#8217;s a bit thick.  The harness adjustment for buckling the child is easy and familiar.  I&#8217;ve seen this system with a pull strap on front before.  Pull the strap to tighten and release the tiny lever to loosen.  There&#8217;s a small pad attached to the crotch strap and the Velcro that holds it on is so small it doesn&#8217;t hold.  It came off the first few times I tried to buckle my child and I gave up on putting it back on.  It&#8217;s a comfort thing and not a safety thing anyway.This seat is bulkier and heavier than most booster only seats.  We&#8217;ll likely keep using it rather than buy a new one but I thought I should mention that.  It&#8217;s something to think about if you&#8217;ll be moving a booster back and forth between vehicles.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "but I&#8217;d feel better if I thought a car seat manufacturer was more ...", "unixReviewTime": 1404000000, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2014"},

Weaver \"PsychoDoc\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "Short story, I was very disappointed with the quality and thought of the engineering on the product.  The best installation I could accomplish severely compromised the strap strength, but in a way that you may not notice or appreciate.  Save your time, check a different brand.Long story: I thoroughly researched the next carseats for our twin boys who are big-ish (90th percentiles) and just passing the rear-facing weight limits.  I compared this in-person to the prior model (Argos 70) based on Consumer Reports ratings.  This looked to be essentially the same.  Otherwise I may have gone for the Nautilus (for fear that the ratings wouldn't apply to this new model), but the Argos had slightly better crash ratings.  Let me say, it really is a nice looking seat, and the surfaces that come into contact with the toddlers are nice. I also really love the easily adjustable height. But...  I spent about 2 hours wrestling this thing around to try to get it to hold position in our seats.  I'm 6\"4 and about 230lbs, so it should be pretty easy for me.  I've also had several seats now, so I'm familiar with different systems and mechanisms of installation.  And, I tried a number of different seat angles, clip placements, head restraint positions, etc.  Point being, I'm capable and was thorough.  For me, the fatal flaw was in the shell structure around the belt path.  I was using the LATCH belt, but the real problem was also present with a seatbelt install.  Namely, the path that the belt must take has it draping down over a plastic corner (so it bunches), some of which is 90degrees and rather sharp (e.g. it would cut a banana, or I assume a compromised belt strap in a crash).  Download the product manual, and you can see, on the page that has the warning that \"Belts must lay flat,\" that the picture of the installation is not logically possible.  It has been altered with the LATCH attachments in the car shown angled (they are not), and a belt shape that on close inspection would lay in a squared U-shape to stay flat and negotiate the turns required by the routing guides.  I thought that this might be new to the new model, but I confirmed the same basic shape with the older Argos and with the Nautilus.  I didn't get out a ruler and measure, but it looked the same.  You can see that they have engineered a smooth belt path that exits directly out the back of the seat (i.e. it would run the belt parallel to the ground).  But, by definition, the belt needs to go back and DOWN at an angle.  Doing so brings it out of that smooth path and over a 90-degree section of the plastic shell (I'll see if I can upload a picture).This being my first time with this size carseat, I got a Britax model for comparison (our last seats were Marathons).  I immediately noticed the difference in engineering. It isn't even close.  The new Graco engineering/construction were similar to the 7-year old Britaxes (although they installed instantly and correctly in minutes).  The engineering and construction has come a LONG way since then.  I wish someone had simply told me that Graco seats weren't to be bothered with.  Furthermore, the biggest perk of the Graco (the design/style) is now offensive because it means they'll do R&D; but evidently only in the window dressing department (which admittedly, Britax could use a dose of).  Other issues: cheap single-belt (i.e. single point-of-failure) LATCH belt, cheap LATCH clips, no energy-absorbing tether,cheap shoulder belt pads, chest clip that somehow simultaneously is IMPOSSIBLE to open and can be opened instantly by a toddler, and worthless crotch belt pad which I think IS actually important.  Finally, for easy (i.e. cheaper) shipping, the seat folds back and forth (the first step of assembly in the manual).  By comparison, the Britax are static and have solid steel beams running basically l-shaped down the side (and have to ship in a big, expensive box).CHECKING FOR YOURSELF: PLEASE go look at some of these in a store.  Look at the belt paths, the clip quality, etc.  Tug on the crotch pad, feel shoulder pads, etc.  Check out the websites: one is all about \"safety is when you have a pad next to your head\" and the other is all about engineering and crash tests.  Also, I do think that some other brands looked more comparable to the Britax than the Graco, so please read this as more of an impeachment of Graco than an endorsement of Britax for anything other than comparison.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "WARNING: May not install properly Rav 4 2010 (2005-2012 model)", "unixReviewTime": 1405036800, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2014"},

I'm not sure if they are discontinuing the Nautilus in favor of the Argos or what, since they seem to pretty much be the same seat. It does look like the side-impact protection might be a bit better on the Argos than the Nautilus (I have both). But if you are trying figure out the different between the two seats, I don't think there is much.What I like about this seat is that you can use it for so long. I've currently got a 4.5 year old who fits very comfortably in the harness now. She is only 40 lbs, and the harness is good for up to 65 lbs. She will outgrow the harness by height before she hits the weight limit though (she's already 44&#34; and I believe they say the upper limit of the harness is about 49&#34;). Once she outgrows the harness she can ride in booster mode until she is big enough to not need a booster anymore.The seat was easy to install. I used my vehicle belt, since a lot of vehicle manufacturers don't rate their LATCH connectors for over 40 lbs. The latch connectors store nicely in the seat when you are not using them. Installation was very straightforward and easy to do. The shoulder straps on the harness are super easy to adjust up and down for your child since you just press the red button on top and slide up and down. The only thing I had a little trouble with was moving the crotch strap for the harness to the outer slot for my bigger child. It was only hard because I was trying to do it wrong at first. I was trying to turn the metal clip sideways to pass it through the slot, but that cause the fabric to bunch up too much. I  just had to turn it so it was skinny and it went right through.I like the built in cup holder and so does my daughter. My other car seat I had to buy a separate cup holder and it is always falling off. The Argos also has a little cubby in the side to keep other treasures your child might have. The cover is washable. Keep in mind how stains will show when you select a color. Black will hide everything but might be hot in the sun. The silver I had on my Nautilus showed all kinds of gross stains that I don't know where they came from.Overall, it is a nice seat. I like it for it's versatility.

At some point you can convert this to a booster, which will obviously make it less safe, but you can use it as a regular car seat up to 65 lbs, which is usually around 8 years of age or so.  The booster phase just means you use only the car seat belt, and remove the built-in 5 point harness; you can optionally remove the back also.  The back may be used up to 100 lbs, and should be left on as long as possible for extra side protection.This car seat is a little heavy at 20lbs, so it is best used in one vehicle.  I was very impressed with the side-impact protection, esp. for the head, which consists of large padded plastic wings directly on each side of the head.  The headrest moves up and down with one hand to adjust the head protection for child height, and automatically secures the shoulder straps at just the right height as well, without needing to adjust the belt length.The overall car seat width is an average 19\", not including the built-in cup holder in the right arm rest which adds an inch.  There are built-in straps for a rear anchor or LATCH systems; of course, traditional seatbelts work fine too, and there's even a shoulder belt clip attached to the back of the seat should you have a seatbelt that doesn't lock.  The armrests don't lift up, but they don't seem to get in the way in our car when entering or exiting.  The armrests have little cubby holes on the insides to hold small items (or dropped fries).It comes adorned with velco pads for the shoulder straps and even the 5-point buckle, which of course will soon get lost, but aren't at all necessary.  There's even a seat pad insert for smaller children 20-30 lbs which is easily removed in seconds once outgrown.  The only adjustment that is a little difficult is moving the bottom belt to the second slot for larger children; this requires removing the carseat from the vehicle and working the clip out of one slot and into the other.  It took me several minutes, but you should only need to do this rarely unless very different sized children will be using the same seat.  The recline feature only allows a slight tilt back, but it can be helpful to fit a variety of seatback slants.This is a solid choice for a safe, well-designed and sturdy forward-facing car seat you don't plan to move often!If you need a rear-facing car seat for a child under 1-2 years of age, consider a convertible seat that can be used rear-facing to start, and then turned around during their second year, such asGraco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seator the deluxeGraco SmartSeat All-in-One Car Seat.

Let me start by saying this system is so easy and convenient.  The inserts snap in so you can have diapers ready as easy as pockets without the extra work.  And are daddy and sitter friendly!  They are super absorbent but without the smell factor that always comes with microfiber.  Thick layers, but still give a trim fit.  I'm buying more.  I wish I had tried these first.  I've got a bunch of pocket covers I won't use anymore, and a good amount of inserts that just don't perform as well.  We are using the medium sized right now, and they are absorbent enough for overnight.  That may change as he grows though.  The best absorbency I can compare these to are Thirsties hemp prefolds, which come second only because I have to fold them.  I'm a fan of the snap in ease of these.  Even if they aren't snapped in, they still work amazing in other covers.  But Best Bottoms are my fav covers too.  Trim and I love that I don't have to swap out a new cover with every change, they keep my baby dry (not in wet leaked on clothes all the time) and wash up great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My favorite inserts - hemp/cotton", "unixReviewTime": 1365033600, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2013"},

Nafziger", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "The Best Bottom system is really great, especially now that my baby is super wiggly during diaper changes--having the insert snap in place makes it a lot easier to get it on him quickly. And if he turns over and starts crawling, I can still get it on him. I also like these at night with the Best Bottom doubler. The fleeciness keeps a little of the wetness off him and the cotton/hemp is easy to launder. They do take a long time to dry because they are so absorbent--1 day in the sun or 2 days indoors.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Convenient snap, very absorbent", "unixReviewTime": 1375747200, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2013"},

They keep moisture away from baby and they snap nicely into the best bottom covers.  They are good quality as well.  A major flaw is that they just aren't wide enough for the shell.
